# Data Sciences Project

### Introduction

This project aims to develop a comprehensive solution for a Data Science project carried out as part of our work at ESPRIT, class of 2024. 

### Objectives

- **Approaches**: Use Data Science techniques, data analysis, and visualization.
- **Implementation**: Develop a user interface, deploy predictive models, and ensure continuous validation.

### Methodology

We follow the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM), an iterative approach to development phases.

### Planning and Sprints

1. **Sprint 1: Data Scraping (Weeks 1-2)**
   - Data collection via Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, Selenium.
   - Automation with SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS).

2. **Sprint 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (Weeks 3-4)**
   - Statistical and visual techniques with Python (Pandas, Seaborn).

3. **Sprint 3: Modeling (Weeks 5-6)**
   - Creation and evaluation of models with PowerBI, Tableau, AutoGluon, MLflow.

4. **Sprint 4: Sentiment Analysis (Week 7)**
   - Natural language processing to understand emotional nuances.

5. **Sprint 5: User Interface Development (Weeks 8-9)**
   - Design and implementation of an interactive web interface.

6. **Sprint 6: Deployment on a Platform (Week 10)**
   - Use of Docker, GitLab CI/CD, Netlify for deployment.

### Deliverables

- Data scraping report and collected data.
- Exploratory data analysis report.
- Prediction model with evaluation report.
- Integration of sentiment analysis.
- Functional user interface.
- Model deployed on a platform with documentation.
