# Analysis and Prediction of Fake Jobs

## Introduction
Welcome to the project "Analysis and Prediction of Fraudulent Job Offers," a Data Science project carried out as part of our work at ESPRIT, class of 2024. This project aims to develop a comprehensive solution to identify and predict fraudulent job offers, which is an increasing issue in the world of online recruitment.

## Objective
Our main objective is to create a tool capable of analyzing and predicting fraudulent job offers using advanced data science and machine learning techniques. We also aim to raise awareness among job seekers and employers about this growing problem.

## Context
With 1.9 billion people employed worldwide and a global unemployment rate of 6.3%, the job market is vast and diverse. Unfortunately, this also includes a rise in fraudulent job offers, which can take various forms such as financial scams, nonexistent job opportunities, or illegal practices.

## Approach and Technology
The project follows the CRISP-DM methodology and is divided into several sprints, each with specific objectives:


1. **Sprint 1: Data Scraping (Weeks 1-2)**
   - Data collection via Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, Selenium.
   - Automation with SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS).

2. **Sprint 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (Weeks 3-4)**
   - Statistical and visual techniques with Python (Pandas, Seaborn).

3. **Sprint 3: Modeling (Weeks 5-6)**
   - Creating and training predictive models using tools like AutoGluon, MLflow, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras.

4. **Sprint 4: Sentiment Analysis (Week 7)**
   - In-depth analysis using natural language processing techniques.

5. **Sprint 5: User Interface Development (Weeks 8-9)**
   - Design and implementation of an interactive web interface.

6. **Sprint 6: Deployment on a Platform (Week 10)**
   - Use of Docker, GitLab CI/CD, Netlify for deployment.

## Deliverables
1. Data scraping report with collected data.
2. Exploratory data analysis report.
3. Predictive model for fraudulent job offers.
4. User interface for interacting with the model.
5. Detailed documentation and user guide.
