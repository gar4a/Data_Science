Our goal of securing the world’s workloads and building a brighter future for humanity requires us to focus on reliable delivery of bar raising security outcomes and investment in security mechanisms and automation on behalf of our customers.
<br>The Amazon Web Services (AWS) Sales, Marketing, and Global Services (SMGS) mission is to enable the AWS field organization to be the most efficient and effective in the world. Our SMGS Security Escalations team builds and maintains org-wide mechanisms to inspect security within SMGS. We identify security challenges, catalyze action to build or improve security mechanisms, and measure security outcomes within SMGS in order to achieve the security outcomes that AWS customers expect. SMGS is looking for a talented Security Engineer, Incident Response who possesses a strong expertise in software and systems, combined with a genuine enthusiasm for security and cloud computing.
<br><br>
SMGS makes broad use of AWS platforms and technologies including cloud services, identity and access management, big data and analytics, all operating at massive scale with consistent growth. SMGS Security helps internal teams with each step of deployment and leads inspection of SMGS’s security posture. Our highly collaborative team is committed to each team member’s growth as our business and team grows. We require engineers to work tactically with both internal and external stakeholders to solve security challenges at massive scale, and to think strategically to develop and implement changes to drive automation, scalability and continuous progress for the organization.
<br><br>
This role will provide career growth opportunities as you gain new security skills in the course of your work. The Security Engineer role in SMGS Security Escalations has two key aspects: on-call operational excellence and capability development. Security engineers in SMGS have an opportunity to experiment, learn, build tools, and work with teams building new technology and services at massive scale. Security engineers at all levels have the opportunity to learn from and be mentored by those who are building and securing our cutting-edge services. A security engineer is also expected to be a mentor for others and be a trusted security advisor within the organization
<br><br>
A Security Engineer at Amazon is expected to have technical expertise in multiple domains and provide significant contributions to the SMGS Security team and to multiple groups throughout Amazon. Security Engineers are expected to take a technically-applied role in assessing and responding to security issues affecting our SMGS services and customers. This role requires a security engineer that can be recognized as an expert within SMGS Security and by teams throughout AWS, while being able to apply security engineering best practices in a broad range of technical areas.
<br><br>
The SMGS Security team is looking for a focused Security Engineer who can take on a leadership role in responding to security issues across the largest cloud provider in the world. You must thrive in high-pressure situations, think like both an attacker and defender, and drive relevant teams to take the right actions in the right time frames to mitigate risks.
<br>We are looking for someone who can balance technical risks against business risks and consistently drive for the right results. You must have the passion for engineering novel solutions to complex security challenges, and recognize and fill gaps in capabilities. The ability to quickly design and build internal-facing tools that enable scaled programmatic automation is a plus.
<br>Up to 10% travel expected.
