<br><br>
This is your chance to make a real difference to the lives of millions through the development and deployment of ground-breaking health and care solutions across Wales.
<br><br>
We have an exciting opportunity for a – Business Analyst to support the Digital Services for Patients and the Public (DSPP) programme to develop and support the next generation of health and care digital services in Wales, including the NHS Wales App.
<br><br>
The NHS Wales app will be a user-facing solution that will connect patients and the public to Welsh health and care services and be accessible to anyone living in Wales to proactively manage their health and access to trusted information on health, care and wellbeing services.
<br><br>
The DSPP programme will also develop the technology for suppliers and practitioners across health and care services in Wales to deploy digital services in a joined-up, safe and secure way, opening-up NHS Wales for future innovations in health and care digital services.

<br><br>
This is your chance to make a real difference to the lives of millions through the development and deployment of ground-breaking health and care solutions across Wales.
<br><br>
We have an exciting opportunity for a – Business Analyst to support the Digital Services for Patients and the Public (DSPP) programme to develop and support the next generation of health and care digital services in Wales, including the NHS Wales App.
<br><br>
The NHS Wales app will be a user-facing solution that will connect patients and the public to Welsh health and care services and be accessible to anyone living in Wales to proactively manage their health and access to trusted information on health, care and wellbeing services.
<br><br>
The DSPP programme will also develop the technology for suppliers and practitioners across health and care services in Wales to deploy digital services in a joined-up, safe and secure way, opening-up NHS Wales for future innovations in health and care digital services.
<br><br>
Members of the public will work with our team, alongside medical and care practitioners, to co-produce this technology and ensure the needs of our community are met.

However, this is a 'full lifecycle' role with possible involvement from business case development to operational review, via requirements, design, development, test and implementation.

The Business Analyst will also support end users both during the programme delivery and business as usual phases given that transition to business operations will be iterative throughout the life of the programme and beyond.

The ability to speak Welsh is desirable for this post; English and/or Welsh speakers are equally welcome to apply.
<br><br>
Digital Health and Care Wales (DHCW) is part of the NHS Wales family and has an important role in changing the way health and care services are delivered through technology and data. The organisation supports frontline staff with modern systems and access to important information about their patients, while empowering the people of Wales to manage their own health through digital NHS Wales services.
<br><br>
DHCW offers opportunities for career growth and professional development. We will work with you and help you develop your career. We offer opportunities to pursue further academic qualifications, up to PhD level. Our benefits include:
<br><br>
Automatic membership of the NHS pension scheme
<br><br>
28 days paid leave plus bank holidays

We have an exciting opportunity for a – Business Analyst to support the Digital Services for Patients and the Public (DSPP) programme to develop and support the next generation of health and care digital services in Wales, including the NHS Wales App.

The NHS Wales app will be a user-facing solution that will connect patients and the public to Welsh health and care services and be accessible to anyone living in Wales to proactively manage their health and access to trusted information on health, care and wellbeing services.
<br><br>
The DSPP programme will also develop the technology for suppliers and practitioners across health and care services in Wales to deploy digital services in a joined-up, safe and secure way, opening-up NHS Wales for future innovations in health and care digital services.

Members of the public will work with our team, alongside medical and care practitioners, to co-produce this technology and ensure the needs of our community are met.

<br><br>
This is your chance to make a real difference to the lives of millions through the development and deployment of ground-breaking health and care solutions across Wales.
<br><br>
We have an exciting opportunity for a – Business Analyst to support the Digital Services for Patients and the Public (DSPP) programme to develop and support the next generation of health and care digital services in Wales, including the NHS Wales App.
<br><br>
The NHS Wales app will be a user-facing solution that will connect patients and the public to Welsh health and care services and be accessible to anyone living in Wales to proactively manage their health and access to trusted information on health, care and wellbeing services.
<br><br>
The DSPP programme will also develop the technology for suppliers and practitioners across health and care services in Wales to deploy digital services in a joined-up, safe and secure way, opening-up NHS Wales for future innovations in health and care digital services.
<br><br>
Members of the public will work with our team, alongside medical and care practitioners, to co-produce this technology and ensure the needs of our community are met.
<br><br>
This role provides business analysis services to projects and teams within the DHCW. A Business Analyst will typically work on many assignments simultaneously; assignments will vary in scale and complexity resulting in work packages that vary from a small number of weeks to several months in duration.
<br><br>
The focus of the Business Analysis function is to clearly elicit, define and document stakeholder requirements which may be technical in nature. However, this is a 'full lifecycle' role with possible involvement from business case development to operational review, via requirements, design, development, test and implementation.
<br><br>
The Business Analyst will also support end users both during the programme delivery and business as usual phases given that transition to business operations will be iterative throughout the life of the programme and beyond.
