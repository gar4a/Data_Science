About Thompson Engineering
Thompson Engineering was formed in 1953 to provide quality assurance for construction projects related to industrial, infrastructure, and community development. As a drilling, materials testing, construction inspection, and chemistry laboratory firm, we supported the engineering and construction industry. Our early years were building blocks that allowed us to get our feet wet - literally - performing services along the Gulf Coast's rivers, bayous, and streams.
Today, Thompson Engineering is known for leadership on projects defining skylines, coastlines, and transportation lines. We support clients in the industrial, commercial, transportation, federal, and municipal markets. While we are still one of the first companies on project sites conducting environmental assessments, land surveys, and geotechnical studies, our design teams are close behind. We now deliver cutting-edge solutions to complex infrastructure and building requirements. And our project management and construction management services mean we are often one of the last teams to leave. From start to finish, we are a proven leader in the planning, design, and construction of major transportation, economic development, and waterfront projects across the Southeast.

Thompson Engineering was formed in 1953 to provide quality assurance for construction projects related to industrial, infrastructure, and community development. As a drilling, materials testing, construction inspection, and chemistry laboratory firm, we supported the engineering and construction industry. Our early years were building blocks that allowed us to get our feet wet - literally - performing services along the Gulf Coast's rivers, bayous, and streams.
Today, Thompson Engineering is known for leadership on projects defining skylines, coastlines, and transportation lines. We support clients in the industrial, commercial, transportation, federal, and municipal markets. While we are still one of the first companies on project sites conducting environmental assessments, land surveys, and geotechnical studies, our design teams are close behind. We now deliver cutting-edge solutions to complex infrastructure and building requirements. And our project management and construction management services mean we are often one of the last teams to leave. From start to finish, we are a proven leader in the planning, design, and construction of major transportation, economic development, and waterfront projects across the Southeast.

Thompson Engineering was formed in 1953 to provide quality assurance for construction projects related to industrial, infrastructure, and community development. As a drilling, materials testing, construction inspection, and chemistry laboratory firm, we supported the engineering and construction industry. Our early years were building blocks that allowed us to get our feet wet - literally - performing services along the Gulf Coast's rivers, bayous, and streams.
Today, Thompson Engineering is known for leadership on projects defining skylines, coastlines, and transportation lines. We support clients in the industrial, commercial, transportation, federal, and municipal markets. While we are still one of the first companies on project sites conducting environmental assessments, land surveys, and geotechnical studies, our design teams are close behind. We now deliver cutting-edge solutions to complex infrastructure and building requirements. And our project management and construction management services mean we are often one of the last teams to leave. From start to finish, we are a proven leader in the planning, design, and construction of major transportation, economic development, and waterfront projects across the Southeast.

About Thompson Engineering
Thompson Engineering was formed in 1953 to provide quality assurance for construction projects related to industrial, infrastructure, and community development. As a drilling, materials testing, construction inspection, and chemistry laboratory firm, we supported the engineering and construction industry. Our early years were building blocks that allowed us to get our feet wet - literally - performing services along the Gulf Coast's rivers, bayous, and streams.
Today, Thompson Engineering is known for leadership on projects defining skylines, coastlines, and transportation lines. We support clients in the industrial, commercial, transportation, federal, and municipal markets. While we are still one of the first companies on project sites conducting environmental assessments, land surveys, and geotechnical studies, our design teams are close behind. We now deliver cutting-edge solutions to complex infrastructure and building requirements. And our project management and construction management services mean we are often one of the last teams to leave. From start to finish, we are a proven leader in the planning, design, and construction of major transportation, economic development, and waterfront projects across the Southeast.

About Thompson Engineering
Thompson Engineering was formed in 1953 to provide quality assurance for construction projects related to industrial, infrastructure, and community development. As a drilling, materials testing, construction inspection, and chemistry laboratory firm, we supported the engineering and construction industry. Our early years were building blocks that allowed us to get our feet wet - literally - performing services along the Gulf Coast's rivers, bayous, and streams.
Today, Thompson Engineering is known for leadership on projects defining skylines, coastlines, and transportation lines. We support clients in the industrial, commercial, transportation, federal, and municipal markets. While we are still one of the first companies on project sites conducting environmental assessments, land surveys, and geotechnical studies, our design teams are close behind. We now deliver cutting-edge solutions to complex infrastructure and building requirements. And our project management and construction management services mean we are often one of the last teams to leave. From start to finish, we are a proven leader in the planning, design, and construction of major transportation, economic development, and waterfront projects across the Southeast.

About Thompson Engineering
Thompson Engineering was formed in 1953 to provide quality assurance for construction projects related to industrial, infrastructure, and community development. As a drilling, materials testing, construction inspection, and chemistry laboratory firm, we supported the engineering and construction industry. Our early years were building blocks that allowed us to get our feet wet - literally - performing services along the Gulf Coast's rivers, bayous, and streams.
Today, Thompson Engineering is known for leadership on projects defining skylines, coastlines, and transportation lines. We support clients in the industrial, commercial, transportation, federal, and municipal markets. While we are still one of the first companies on project sites conducting environmental assessments, land surveys, and geotechnical studies, our design teams are close behind. We now deliver cutting-edge solutions to complex infrastructure and building requirements. And our project management and construction management services mean we are often one of the last teams to leave. From start to finish, we are a proven leader in the planning, design, and construction of major transportation, economic development, and waterfront projects across the Southeast.
