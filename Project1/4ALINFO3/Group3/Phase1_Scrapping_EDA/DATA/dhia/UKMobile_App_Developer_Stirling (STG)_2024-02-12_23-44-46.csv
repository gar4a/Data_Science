Because people can only be their best when they not only feel safe, but are safe. We're solving for safer by building the best possible technologies across every part of our safety and security ecosystem. That's mission-critical communications devices and networks, AI-powered video security & access control and the ability to unite voice, video and data in a single command center view. We're solving for safer by connecting public safety agencies and enterprises, enabling the collaboration that's critical to connect those in need with those who can help. The work we do here matters. Department Overview On any given day, every moment matters to someone, somewhere. And every moment, Motorola Solutions’ innovations, products and services play essential roles in people’s lives. We help firefighters see around buildings and police officers see around street corners. We keep utility workers connected and visible to each other with real-time voice and data communication across the smart grid. And we provide the situational awareness first responders need when a moment brings catastrophe. We help people be their best in their moments that matter. Our UK Deployment team provides mission critical software to UK emergency service agencies, with our primary focus being the Pronto Digital Policing app and the CommandCentral Control Room Solution. Pronto is the most popular mobile policing application in the UK, trusted by over half of the UK’s 45 police forces - and used by around 60,000 police officers on a daily basis. Pronto has been designed with and for front line operational users. As a result, it is an intuitive solution, with positive adoption, excellent user compliance and consistently positive feedback. CommmandCentral Control Room Solution (CRS) provides an integrated voice, data and multimedia communications hub that harnesses the power of the cloud to simplify control room IT management. Used by both Police and Fire agencies, CommmandCentral CRS is fast becoming the premier control room solution in the UK market, and beyond. Based in the West End of Glasgow, we currently have around 100 employees. Our team started as Kelvin Connect in 2002, a spin-out company from the University of Glasgow.

You will start off in the programme as a Developer, and will be responsible for writing Java, XSLT and using our in-house tools to produce Android applications.

That's mission-critical communications devices and networks, AI-powered video security & access control and the ability to unite voice, video and data in a single command center view. We're solving for safer by connecting public safety agencies and enterprises, enabling the collaboration that's critical to connect those in need with those who can help. The work we do here matters.

That's mission-critical communications devices and networks, AI-powered video security & access control and the ability to unite voice, video and data in a single command center view. We're solving for safer by connecting public safety agencies and enterprises, enabling the collaboration that's critical to connect those in need with those who can help. The work we do here matters.

That's mission-critical communications devices and networks, AI-powered video security & access control and the ability to unite voice, video and data in a single command center view. We're solving for safer by connecting public safety agencies and enterprises, enabling the collaboration that's critical to connect those in need with those who can help. The work we do here matters.
