This project aims to address the current limitations of traditional frame-based sensors and associated processing pipelines with a new family of algorithmic architectures that mimic more closely the behaviours of biological brains. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) can offer increased processing speed and reduced power consumption, especially when implemented on dedicated hardware (neuromorphic chips or FPGAs). Standard SNNs are typically fed with spiking data (e.g., streams of binary values), and the output of each layer remains spiking. They are particularly well suited for several new sensors, such as event-cameras, or single-photon detectors (used for single-photon Lidar), that natively produce event-like data that is compatible with spiking networks. Similarly, detection events from RF (radar and electronic surveillance) sensors can also be seen as temporal events. While data from current sensors can be manually converted into events for fast processing, it is also possible to develop hybrid structures where some layers (such as the input and/or output layer) are traditional (continuous) layers. SNNs appear promising at the conceptual level but they currently suffer from limitations preventing the broad deployment. First, efficient and scalable training procedure are still needed, irrespective of whether the training is done off-line on a traditional GPU-based architecture, on neuromorphic hardware. Second, deployment of SNNs on actual neuromorphic hardware can come with additional structural constraints on the SNNs, such that quantization of the network weights which induces additional constraints on the training strategies. In this project, we will investigate Bayesian methods to train deterministic SNNs (with deterministic activation functions) or probabilistic SNNs. Bayesian deep learning methods have been shown to accelerate and improve the training procedure of SNNs by defining new cost functions that are differentiable and easier to optimize. They can also handle quantized weights, e.g., using the reparameterization trick. Still, while methodological tools (first principles) exist, their application to solve real world problems still need to be demonstrated. This is what we intend to achieve in this project. Research Environment The project is in collaboration with two partners: (i) IDCOM at the University of Edinburgh, which develops theory, algorithms and hardware for the next generation of signal processing, imaging and communication systems and (ii) Leonardo UK, providing application expertise and end-user feedback. The applicant will be expected to work directly with Dr. Yoann Altmann, Prof. Steve McLaughlin from the Institute of Sensors and Signals (ISS) at Heriot-Watt University and Prof. Mike Davies at the University of Edinburgh, Leonardo staff, PhD students and the other PDRAs at the collaborating partner institutions. â€¯ The PDRA will report on project progress and outcomes to the Prosperity Partnership Management Group, as well as participating in Knowledge Transfer Meetings and Workshops with a broad range of Leonardo personnel. Most of the project will be executed, in the at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, with some joint work also executed at Leonardo UK, Edinburgh. Key Duties and Responsibilities We are looking for a creative and highly motivated researcher willing to work as part of a team. Good communication skills and an appropriate publication record are essential. General tasks will involve scientific research; analysis and interpretation of data; daily oversight of the activities of postgraduate and undergraduate project students in the laboratory; communication with other investigators involved in this collaborative project; preparation of scientific papers; presentation of research at conferences whilst also supervising the activities of junior group members and PhD students.

Use our total rewards calculator: https://www.hw.ac.uk/about/work/total-rewards-calculator.htm to see the value of benefits provided by Heriot-Watt University Detailed Description A Post-Doctoral Research Associate (PDRA) is needed for a research project, fully funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), initially for 12 months from 1st July 2023 or as soon as possible but can be extended depending on the availability of funding. The research project COG-MHEAR: Towards cognitively inspired 5G-IoT enabled, multi-modal Hearing Aids funded by UK research council (EPSRC), involves six academic partners including University of Edinburgh and industrial partners including Bell-Labs, Alcatel-Lucent Technologies, USA and Sonova AG. The research will explore and validate the new concept hearing-aid to transform hearing care by 2050, we aim to completely re-think the way HAs are designed. Our transformative approach - for the first time - draws on the cognitive principles of normal hearing. Listeners naturally combine information from both their ears and eyes: we use our eyes to help us hear. We will create ""multi-modal"" aids which not only amplify sounds but contextually use simultaneously collected information from a range of sensors to improve speech intelligibility. Adding in these new sensors and the processing that is required to make sense of the data produced will place a significant additional power and miniaturization burden on the HA device. We will need to make our sophisticated visual and sound processing algorithms operate with minimum power and minimum delay, and will achieve this by making dedicated hardware implementations, accelerating the key processing steps. In the long term, we aim for all processing to be done in the HA itself - keeping data local to the person for privacy. In the shorter term, some processing will need to be done in the cloud (as it is too power intensive) and we will create new very low latency (<10ms) interfaces to cloud infrastructure to avoid delays between when a word is ""seen"" being spoken and when it is heard. We also plan to utilize advances in flexible electronics (e-skin) and antenna design to make the overall unit as small, discreet, and usable as possible. We are seeking to recruit a highly motivated PDRA willing to work as part of a team in this project to support the development of IoT communications links and machine learning. Applicants must have a PhD degree (or have submitted a PhD thesis) in Electrical, Electronic, computer engineering, Computer science or a related discipline, have excellent knowledge and strong background in Signal Processing for wireless communications/ networks (in particular physical/ cross layer technologies), MIMO signal processing, interference management, machine learning, beamforming, precoding, channel estimation, IoT, user interface technologies, mathematics and optimisation evidenced by high-quality research publications.
