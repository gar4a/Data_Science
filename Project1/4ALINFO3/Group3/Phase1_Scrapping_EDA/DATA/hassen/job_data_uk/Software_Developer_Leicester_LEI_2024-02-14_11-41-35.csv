We&rsquo;ve experienced rapid growth in recent years and have introduced a <b>microservices strategy</b> based around Kubernetes to leave our monolith behind and to standardise our processes.

What we offer</b></p><ul>

<p></p><div>Pektron Group Ltd is searching for an Embedded Software Engineer who will be responsible for writing software for a range of bespoke products.</div>
<div></div><div>Our team:</div>
<div>Our Engineering attitude is confident and &ldquo;can do&rdquo; and with solid research and a lot of intuition we nearly always succeed.</div>
<div></div><div>Nearly all of our code is written in C, mainly because it&rsquo;s the most widely available language for the variety of 8, 16, 32 bit micros we use on our boards and we&rsquo;re good at it! We pride ourselves on efficient reliable software and we mix our hardware and software teams together so that we can get the most out of our micros and we get it right first time. All of our code is collaboratively developed with our peers, so you get to learn from the people that know that technology best.</div>
<div></div><div>We are geeks and proud! We love engineering and our lunchtime conversations are made up of 3D printing, power generation, hyper cars (we sometimes get to play with these), electric vehicles (we&rsquo;ve worked on some of these too) and any other areas of science and technology.</div>
<div></div><div>Last year we started developing our Application code using model based design using the Matlab toolchain, allowing us to spend less time on coding and more time thinking about good quality architecture and design and let the tools (when driven correctly) do the coding! Obviously, there&rsquo;s always plenty of code to be written and we continue to do low and middle level software the traditional way.</div>
<div></div><div>You:</div>
<div>You will be a highly motivated and self-managing Embedded Software Engineer with preferably the experience of working in a customer facing, commercial environment. You will have a highly developed, structured approach to design and the ability to compose a design rationale, along with good technical writing skills and a willingness to work within our collaboratively developed software design ethics and style.</div>
<div></div><div>The role:</div>
<div>You will be working within the Software Development Team which is part a multi-disciplined engineering team, consisting of Mechanical, Electronic and Firmware Engineers (approx. 60 in total). New business is primarily focussed in the high performance and luxury car markets; however Pektron designs and manufactures a wide range of products for Gas, Automotive, Safety and Consumer industries. You will have the opportunity to write software for interesting and diverse projects as well as specify tools, requirements and drive the software discipline within the company, and to be involved in every aspect of the product lifecycle from quotation, concept, design, and validation through to manufacture.</div>
<div></div><div>Recent projects include:</div>
<div>Design and manufacture of advanced body control systems including passive keys and active suspension systems for high performance vehicles.</div>
<div>Developing advanced instrument clusters, passive entry systems, body and chassis control systems for major OEM clients in the automotive, agricultural and construction sectors.</div>
<div></div><div>Experience and skills required:</div>
<div>Exceptional Fault Diagnosis and Analysis</div>
<div>Embedded Programing in C</div>
<div>Version Control</div>
<div>Static Analysis / Code Metrics</div>
<div>Microprocessors 8, 16 &amp; 32 bit</div>
<div>Low Level Drivers for External Hardware / CPU Peripherals or Embedded Application Development</div>
<div>Communication &ndash; Spoken/Written/Technical English must be of a minimum of IELTS 7 or SELT B1</div>
<div></div><div>Additional points that would be an advantage</div>
<div>Knowledge of Real Time Control</div>
<div>Experience of Software Architecture and Detailed Design</div>
<div>Ability to travel freely (some customers are based in US / EU)</div>
<div>Familiarity of working within MISRA C rules</div>
<div>Working experience of AUTOSAR architecture</div>
<div>Programing: Windows/Linux, Visual Basic, C++, high level structured languages</div>

<div>Control of Graphic Displays</div>
<div>Communications Protocols: Serial, CAN, LIN, Diagnostic, Ethernet</div>
<div>Use Vector Vehicle Networking Tools such as CANoe/CANalyser</div>
<div>Design / Modelling experience (For example: UML, Matlab, Simulink, Rhapsody or Targetlink)</div>
<div>Experience of Graphics Processors &amp; Driving TFT displays</div>
<div>Knowledge of CMMI / SPICE / ASPICE process frameworks</div>
<div>Practical experience of working to ISO26262 ASIL-B or similar</div>

<p></p><div>Pektron Group Ltd is searching for an Embedded Software Engineer who will be responsible for writing software for a range of bespoke products.</div>
<div></div><div>Our team:</div>
<div>Our Engineering attitude is confident and &ldquo;can do&rdquo; and with solid research and a lot of intuition we nearly always succeed.</div>
<div></div><div>Nearly all of our code is written in C, mainly because it&rsquo;s the most widely available language for the variety of 8, 16, 32 bit micros we use on our boards and we&rsquo;re good at it! We pride ourselves on efficient reliable software and we mix our hardware and software teams together so that we can get the most out of our micros and we get it right first time. All of our code is collaboratively developed with our peers, so you get to learn from the people that know that technology best.</div>
<div></div><div>We are geeks and proud! We love engineering and our lunchtime conversations are made up of 3D printing, power generation, hyper cars (we sometimes get to play with these), electric vehicles (we&rsquo;ve worked on some of these too) and any other areas of science and technology.</div>
<div></div><div>Last year we started developing our Application code using model based design using the Matlab toolchain, allowing us to spend less time on coding and more time thinking about good quality architecture and design and let the tools (when driven correctly) do the coding! Obviously, there&rsquo;s always plenty of code to be written and we continue to do low and middle level software the traditional way.</div>
<div></div><div>You:</div>
<div>You will be a highly motivated and self-managing Embedded Software Engineer with preferably the experience of working in a customer facing, commercial environment. You will have a highly developed, structured approach to design and the ability to compose a design rationale, along with good technical writing skills and a willingness to work within our collaboratively developed software design ethics and style.</div>
<div></div><div>The role:</div>
<div>You will be working within the Software Development Team which is part a multi-disciplined engineering team, consisting of Mechanical, Electronic and Firmware Engineers (approx. 60 in total). New business is primarily focussed in the high performance and luxury car markets; however Pektron designs and manufactures a wide range of products for Gas, Automotive, Safety and Consumer industries. You will have the opportunity to write software for interesting and diverse projects as well as specify tools, requirements and drive the software discipline within the company, and to be involved in every aspect of the product lifecycle from quotation, concept, design, and validation through to manufacture.</div>
<div></div><div>Recent projects include:</div>
<div>Design and manufacture of advanced body control systems including passive keys and active suspension systems for high performance vehicles.</div>
<div>Developing advanced instrument clusters, passive entry systems, body and chassis control systems for major OEM clients in the automotive, agricultural and construction sectors.</div>
<div></div><div>Experience and skills required:</div>
<div>Exceptional Fault Diagnosis and Analysis</div>
<div>Embedded Programing in C</div>
<div>Version Control</div>
<div>Static Analysis / Code Metrics</div>
<div>Microprocessors 8, 16 &amp; 32 bit</div>
<div>Low Level Drivers for External Hardware / CPU Peripherals or Embedded Application Development</div>
<div>Communication &ndash; Spoken/Written/Technical English must be of a minimum of IELTS 7 or SELT B1</div>
<div></div><div>Additional points that would be an advantage</div>
<div>Knowledge of Real Time Control</div>
<div>Experience of Software Architecture and Detailed Design</div>
<div>Ability to travel freely (some customers are based in US / EU)</div>
<div>Familiarity of working within MISRA C rules</div>
<div>Working experience of AUTOSAR architecture</div>
<div>Programing: Windows/Linux, Visual Basic, C++, high level structured languages</div>
<div>Simple Electronic Design: Analogue / Digital</div>
<div>Control of Graphic Displays</div>
<div>Communications Protocols: Serial, CAN, LIN, Diagnostic, Ethernet</div>
<div>Use Vector Vehicle Networking Tools such as CANoe/CANalyser</div>
<div>Design / Modelling experience (For example: UML, Matlab, Simulink, Rhapsody or Targetlink)</div>
<div>Experience of Graphics Processors &amp; Driving TFT displays</div>
<div>Knowledge of CMMI / SPICE / ASPICE process frameworks</div>
<div>Practical experience of working to ISO26262 ASIL-B or similar</div>
<div></div>

<p></p><div>Pektron Group Ltd is searching for an Embedded Software Engineer who will be responsible for writing software for a range of bespoke products.</div>
<div></div><div>Our team:</div>
<div>Our Engineering attitude is confident and &ldquo;can do&rdquo; and with solid research and a lot of intuition we nearly always succeed.</div>
<div></div><div>Nearly all of our code is written in C, mainly because it&rsquo;s the most widely available language for the variety of 8, 16, 32 bit micros we use on our boards and we&rsquo;re good at it! We pride ourselves on efficient reliable software and we mix our hardware and software teams together so that we can get the most out of our micros and we get it right first time. All of our code is collaboratively developed with our peers, so you get to learn from the people that know that technology best.</div>
<div></div><div>We are geeks and proud! We love engineering and our lunchtime conversations are made up of 3D printing, power generation, hyper cars (we sometimes get to play with these), electric vehicles (we&rsquo;ve worked on some of these too) and any other areas of science and technology.</div>
<div></div><div>Last year we started developing our Application code using model based design using the Matlab toolchain, allowing us to spend less time on coding and more time thinking about good quality architecture and design and let the tools (when driven correctly) do the coding! Obviously, there&rsquo;s always plenty of code to be written and we continue to do low and middle level software the traditional way.</div>
<div></div><div>You:</div>
<div>You will be a highly motivated and self-managing Embedded Software Engineer with preferably the experience of working in a customer facing, commercial environment. You will have a highly developed, structured approach to design and the ability to compose a design rationale, along with good technical writing skills and a willingness to work within our collaboratively developed software design ethics and style.</div>
<div></div><div>The role:</div>
<div>You will be working within the Software Development Team which is part a multi-disciplined engineering team, consisting of Mechanical, Electronic and Firmware Engineers (approx. 60 in total). New business is primarily focussed in the high performance and luxury car markets; however Pektron designs and manufactures a wide range of products for Gas, Automotive, Safety and Consumer industries. You will have the opportunity to write software for interesting and diverse projects as well as specify tools, requirements and drive the software discipline within the company, and to be involved in every aspect of the product lifecycle from quotation, concept, design, and validation through to manufacture.</div>
<div></div><div>Recent projects include:</div>
<div>Design and manufacture of advanced body control systems including passive keys and active suspension systems for high performance vehicles.</div>
<div>Developing advanced instrument clusters, passive entry systems, body and chassis control systems for major OEM clients in the automotive, agricultural and construction sectors.</div>
<div></div><div>Experience and skills required:</div>
<div>Exceptional Fault Diagnosis and Analysis</div>
<div>Embedded Programing in C</div>
<div>Version Control</div>
<div>Static Analysis / Code Metrics</div>
<div>Microprocessors 8, 16 &amp; 32 bit</div>
<div>Low Level Drivers for External Hardware / CPU Peripherals or Embedded Application Development</div>
<div>Communication &ndash; Spoken/Written/Technical English must be of a minimum of IELTS 7 or SELT B1</div>
<div></div><div>Additional points that would be an advantage</div>
<div>Knowledge of Real Time Control</div>
<div>Experience of Software Architecture and Detailed Design</div>
<div>Ability to travel freely (some customers are based in US / EU)</div>
<div>Familiarity of working within MISRA C rules</div>
<div>Working experience of AUTOSAR architecture</div>
<div>Programing: Windows/Linux, Visual Basic, C++, high level structured languages</div>
<div>Simple Electronic Design: Analogue / Digital</div>
<div>Control of Graphic Displays</div>
<div>Communications Protocols: Serial, CAN, LIN, Diagnostic, Ethernet</div>
<div>Use Vector Vehicle Networking Tools such as CANoe/CANalyser</div>
<div>Design / Modelling experience (For example: UML, Matlab, Simulink, Rhapsody or Targetlink)</div>
<div>Experience of Graphics Processors &amp; Driving TFT displays</div>
<div>Knowledge of CMMI / SPICE / ASPICE process frameworks</div>
<div>Practical experience of working to ISO26262 ASIL-B or similar</div>

<p></p><div>Pektron Group Ltd is searching for an Embedded Software Engineer who will be responsible for writing software for a range of bespoke products.</div>
<div></div><div>Our team:</div>
<div>Our Engineering attitude is confident and &ldquo;can do&rdquo; and with solid research and a lot of intuition we nearly always succeed.</div>
<div></div><div>Nearly all of our code is written in C, mainly because it&rsquo;s the most widely available language for the variety of 8, 16, 32 bit micros we use on our boards and we&rsquo;re good at it! We pride ourselves on efficient reliable software and we mix our hardware and software teams together so that we can get the most out of our micros and we get it right first time. All of our code is collaboratively developed with our peers, so you get to learn from the people that know that technology best.</div>
<div></div><div>We are geeks and proud! We love engineering and our lunchtime conversations are made up of 3D printing, power generation, hyper cars (we sometimes get to play with these), electric vehicles (we&rsquo;ve worked on some of these too) and any other areas of science and technology.</div>
<div></div><div>Last year we started developing our Application code using model based design using the Matlab toolchain, allowing us to spend less time on coding and more time thinking about good quality architecture and design and let the tools (when driven correctly) do the coding! Obviously, there&rsquo;s always plenty of code to be written and we continue to do low and middle level software the traditional way.</div>
<div></div><div>You:</div>
<div>You will be a highly motivated and self-managing Embedded Software Engineer with preferably the experience of working in a customer facing, commercial environment. You will have a highly developed, structured approach to design and the ability to compose a design rationale, along with good technical writing skills and a willingness to work within our collaboratively developed software design ethics and style.</div>
<div></div><div>The role:</div>
<div>You will be working within the Software Development Team which is part a multi-disciplined engineering team, consisting of Mechanical, Electronic and Firmware Engineers (approx. 60 in total). New business is primarily focussed in the high performance and luxury car markets; however Pektron designs and manufactures a wide range of products for Gas, Automotive, Safety and Consumer industries. You will have the opportunity to write software for interesting and diverse projects as well as specify tools, requirements and drive the software discipline within the company, and to be involved in every aspect of the product lifecycle from quotation, concept, design, and validation through to manufacture.</div>
<div></div><div>Recent projects include:</div>
<div>Design and manufacture of advanced body control systems including passive keys and active suspension systems for high performance vehicles.</div>
<div>Developing advanced instrument clusters, passive entry systems, body and chassis control systems for major OEM clients in the automotive, agricultural and construction sectors.</div>
<div></div><div>Experience and skills required:</div>
<div>Exceptional Fault Diagnosis and Analysis</div>
<div>Embedded Programing in C</div>
<div>Version Control</div>
<div>Static Analysis / Code Metrics</div>
<div>Microprocessors 8, 16 &amp; 32 bit</div>
<div>Low Level Drivers for External Hardware / CPU Peripherals or Embedded Application Development</div>
<div>Communication &ndash; Spoken/Written/Technical English must be of a minimum of IELTS 7 or SELT B1</div>
<div></div><div>Additional points that would be an advantage</div>
<div>Knowledge of Real Time Control</div>
<div>Experience of Software Architecture and Detailed Design</div>
<div>Ability to travel freely (some customers are based in US / EU)</div>
<div>Familiarity of working within MISRA C rules</div>
<div>Working experience of AUTOSAR architecture</div>
<div>Programing: Windows/Linux, Visual Basic, C++, high level structured languages</div>
<div>Simple Electronic Design: Analogue / Digital</div>
<div>Control of Graphic Displays</div>
<div>Communications Protocols: Serial, CAN, LIN, Diagnostic, Ethernet</div>
<div>Use Vector Vehicle Networking Tools such as CANoe/CANalyser</div>
<div>Design / Modelling experience (For example: UML, Matlab, Simulink, Rhapsody or Targetlink)</div>
<div>Experience of Graphics Processors &amp; Driving TFT displays</div>
<div>Knowledge of CMMI / SPICE / ASPICE process frameworks</div>
<div>Practical experience of working to ISO26262 ASIL-B or similar</div>
<div></div>

<p>
Competitive salaries</p>

</div><p>Viva IT is an innovative and exciting fintech. We specialise in creating mobile app and web-based financial software. Although we have a fully remote workforce, we are centred in the East Midlands, UK.</p>
<p>
We believe there are just a few simple things needed to create great software: state of the art technology, a continuously delivering pipeline of code, a purpose, a relaxed working environment, and most importantly a like minded team of people.
</p><p>We take an hybrid-agile approach to product development, forgoing the traditional vertical structure of management, meaning that even our newest developers will be given opportunities and encouraged to lead and learn.
</p><p><b>We're looking for software engineers who share our passion for code</b>. We're primarily a PHP team, but we're strong believers that language doesn't matter - the kind of software engineer we're looking for will be able to create magic, regardless of the language however previous experience in our tools will be a bonus.</p>
<p>
We use an array of tools, technologies and frameworks including:</p>
<ul>
<li>PHP 8.2</li>
<li>Symfony LTS releases including: 5.4 and 6.4</li>
<li>MySQL
</li><li>React</li>

<li>PHPUnit

<li>YouTrack</li>

We release multiple times a day through a fully automated release pipeline, this is development in the fast lane and there is no room to dawdle.</p>
<p>

<p></p><div>Pektron Group Ltd is searching for an Embedded Software Engineer who will be responsible for writing software for a range of bespoke products.</div>
<div></div><div>Our team:</div>
<div>Our Engineering attitude is confident and &ldquo;can do&rdquo; and with solid research and a lot of intuition we nearly always succeed.</div>
<div></div><div>Nearly all of our code is written in C, mainly because it&rsquo;s the most widely available language for the variety of 8, 16, 32 bit micros we use on our boards and we&rsquo;re good at it! We pride ourselves on efficient reliable software and we mix our hardware and software teams together so that we can get the most out of our micros and we get it right first time. All of our code is collaboratively developed with our peers, so you get to learn from the people that know that technology best.</div>
<div></div><div>We are geeks and proud! We love engineering and our lunchtime conversations are made up of 3D printing, power generation, hyper cars (we sometimes get to play with these), electric vehicles (we&rsquo;ve worked on some of these too) and any other areas of science and technology.</div>
<div></div><div>Last year we started developing our Application code using model based design using the Matlab toolchain, allowing us to spend less time on coding and more time thinking about good quality architecture and design and let the tools (when driven correctly) do the coding! Obviously, there&rsquo;s always plenty of code to be written and we continue to do low and middle level software the traditional way.</div>
<div></div><div>You:</div>
<div>You will be a highly motivated and self-managing Embedded Software Engineer with preferably the experience of working in a customer facing, commercial environment. You will have a highly developed, structured approach to design and the ability to compose a design rationale, along with good technical writing skills and a willingness to work within our collaboratively developed software design ethics and style.</div>
<div></div><div>The role:</div>
<div>You will be working within the Software Development Team which is part a multi-disciplined engineering team, consisting of Mechanical, Electronic and Firmware Engineers (approx. 60 in total). New business is primarily focussed in the high performance and luxury car markets; however Pektron designs and manufactures a wide range of products for Gas, Automotive, Safety and Consumer industries. You will have the opportunity to write software for interesting and diverse projects as well as specify tools, requirements and drive the software discipline within the company, and to be involved in every aspect of the product lifecycle from quotation, concept, design, and validation through to manufacture.</div>
<div></div><div>Recent projects include:</div>
<div>Design and manufacture of advanced body control systems including passive keys and active suspension systems for high performance vehicles.</div>
<div>Developing advanced instrument clusters, passive entry systems, body and chassis control systems for major OEM clients in the automotive, agricultural and construction sectors.</div>
<div></div><div>Experience and skills required:</div>
<div>Exceptional Fault Diagnosis and Analysis</div>
<div>Embedded Programing in C</div>
<div>Version Control</div>
<div>Static Analysis / Code Metrics</div>
<div>Microprocessors 8, 16 &amp; 32 bit</div>
<div>Low Level Drivers for External Hardware / CPU Peripherals or Embedded Application Development</div>
<div>Communication &ndash; Spoken/Written/Technical English must be of a minimum of IELTS 7 or SELT B1</div>
<div></div><div>Additional points that would be an advantage</div>
<div>Knowledge of Real Time Control</div>
<div>Experience of Software Architecture and Detailed Design</div>
<div>Ability to travel freely (some customers are based in US / EU)</div>
<div>Familiarity of working within MISRA C rules</div>
<div>Working experience of AUTOSAR architecture</div>
<div>Programing: Windows/Linux, Visual Basic, C++, high level structured languages</div>
<div>Simple Electronic Design: Analogue / Digital</div>
<div>Control of Graphic Displays</div>
<div>Communications Protocols: Serial, CAN, LIN, Diagnostic, Ethernet</div>
<div>Use Vector Vehicle Networking Tools such as CANoe/CANalyser</div>
<div>Design / Modelling experience (For example: UML, Matlab, Simulink, Rhapsody or Targetlink)</div>
<div>Experience of Graphics Processors &amp; Driving TFT displays</div>
<div>Knowledge of CMMI / SPICE / ASPICE process frameworks</div>
<div>Practical experience of working to ISO26262 ASIL-B or similar</div>

<p></p><div>Pektron Group Ltd is searching for an Embedded Software Engineer who will be responsible for writing software for a range of bespoke products.</div>
<div></div><div>Our team:</div>
<div>Our Engineering attitude is confident and &ldquo;can do&rdquo; and with solid research and a lot of intuition we nearly always succeed.</div>
<div></div><div>Nearly all of our code is written in C, mainly because it&rsquo;s the most widely available language for the variety of 8, 16, 32 bit micros we use on our boards and we&rsquo;re good at it! We pride ourselves on efficient reliable software and we mix our hardware and software teams together so that we can get the most out of our micros and we get it right first time. All of our code is collaboratively developed with our peers, so you get to learn from the people that know that technology best.</div>
<div></div><div>We are geeks and proud! We love engineering and our lunchtime conversations are made up of 3D printing, power generation, hyper cars (we sometimes get to play with these), electric vehicles (we&rsquo;ve worked on some of these too) and any other areas of science and technology.</div>
<div></div><div>Last year we started developing our Application code using model based design using the Matlab toolchain, allowing us to spend less time on coding and more time thinking about good quality architecture and design and let the tools (when driven correctly) do the coding! Obviously, there&rsquo;s always plenty of code to be written and we continue to do low and middle level software the traditional way.</div>
<div></div><div>You:</div>
<div>You will be a highly motivated and self-managing Embedded Software Engineer with preferably the experience of working in a customer facing, commercial environment. You will have a highly developed, structured approach to design and the ability to compose a design rationale, along with good technical writing skills and a willingness to work within our collaboratively developed software design ethics and style.</div>
<div></div><div>The role:</div>
<div>You will be working within the Software Development Team which is part a multi-disciplined engineering team, consisting of Mechanical, Electronic and Firmware Engineers (approx. 60 in total). New business is primarily focussed in the high performance and luxury car markets; however Pektron designs and manufactures a wide range of products for Gas, Automotive, Safety and Consumer industries. You will have the opportunity to write software for interesting and diverse projects as well as specify tools, requirements and drive the software discipline within the company, and to be involved in every aspect of the product lifecycle from quotation, concept, design, and validation through to manufacture.</div>
<div></div><div>Recent projects include:</div>
<div>Design and manufacture of advanced body control systems including passive keys and active suspension systems for high performance vehicles.</div>
<div>Developing advanced instrument clusters, passive entry systems, body and chassis control systems for major OEM clients in the automotive, agricultural and construction sectors.</div>
<div></div><div>Experience and skills required:</div>
<div>Exceptional Fault Diagnosis and Analysis</div>
<div>Embedded Programing in C</div>
<div>Version Control</div>
<div>Static Analysis / Code Metrics</div>
<div>Microprocessors 8, 16 &amp; 32 bit</div>
<div>Low Level Drivers for External Hardware / CPU Peripherals or Embedded Application Development</div>
<div>Communication &ndash; Spoken/Written/Technical English must be of a minimum of IELTS 7 or SELT B1</div>
<div></div><div>Additional points that would be an advantage</div>
<div>Knowledge of Real Time Control</div>
<div>Experience of Software Architecture and Detailed Design</div>
<div>Ability to travel freely (some customers are based in US / EU)</div>
<div>Familiarity of working within MISRA C rules</div>
<div>Working experience of AUTOSAR architecture</div>
<div>Programing: Windows/Linux, Visual Basic, C++, high level structured languages</div>
<div>Simple Electronic Design: Analogue / Digital</div>
<div>Control of Graphic Displays</div>
<div>Communications Protocols: Serial, CAN, LIN, Diagnostic, Ethernet</div>
<div>Use Vector Vehicle Networking Tools such as CANoe/CANalyser</div>
<div>Design / Modelling experience (For example: UML, Matlab, Simulink, Rhapsody or Targetlink)</div>
<div>Experience of Graphics Processors &amp; Driving TFT displays</div>
<div>Knowledge of CMMI / SPICE / ASPICE process frameworks</div>
<div>Practical experience of working to ISO26262 ASIL-B or similar</div>
<div></div>

<p>
Competitive salaries</p>
<p>

<p></p><div>Pektron Group Ltd is searching for an Embedded Software Engineer who will be responsible for writing software for a range of bespoke products.</div>
<div></div><div>Our team:</div>
<div>Our Engineering attitude is confident and &ldquo;can do&rdquo; and with solid research and a lot of intuition we nearly always succeed.</div>
<div></div><div>Nearly all of our code is written in C, mainly because it&rsquo;s the most widely available language for the variety of 8, 16, 32 bit micros we use on our boards and we&rsquo;re good at it! We pride ourselves on efficient reliable software and we mix our hardware and software teams together so that we can get the most out of our micros and we get it right first time. All of our code is collaboratively developed with our peers, so you get to learn from the people that know that technology best.</div>
<div></div><div>We are geeks and proud! We love engineering and our lunchtime conversations are made up of 3D printing, power generation, hyper cars (we sometimes get to play with these), electric vehicles (we&rsquo;ve worked on some of these too) and any other areas of science and technology.</div>
<div></div><div>Last year we started developing our Application code using model based design using the Matlab toolchain, allowing us to spend less time on coding and more time thinking about good quality architecture and design and let the tools (when driven correctly) do the coding! Obviously, there&rsquo;s always plenty of code to be written and we continue to do low and middle level software the traditional way.</div>
<div></div><div>You:</div>
<div>You will be a highly motivated and self-managing Embedded Software Engineer with preferably the experience of working in a customer facing, commercial environment. You will have a highly developed, structured approach to design and the ability to compose a design rationale, along with good technical writing skills and a willingness to work within our collaboratively developed software design ethics and style.</div>
<div></div><div>The role:</div>
<div>You will be working within the Software Development Team which is part a multi-disciplined engineering team, consisting of Mechanical, Electronic and Firmware Engineers (approx. 60 in total). New business is primarily focussed in the high performance and luxury car markets; however Pektron designs and manufactures a wide range of products for Gas, Automotive, Safety and Consumer industries. You will have the opportunity to write software for interesting and diverse projects as well as specify tools, requirements and drive the software discipline within the company, and to be involved in every aspect of the product lifecycle from quotation, concept, design, and validation through to manufacture.</div>
<div></div><div>Recent projects include:</div>
<div>Design and manufacture of advanced body control systems including passive keys and active suspension systems for high performance vehicles.</div>
<div>Developing advanced instrument clusters, passive entry systems, body and chassis control systems for major OEM clients in the automotive, agricultural and construction sectors.</div>
<div></div><div>Experience and skills required:</div>
<div>Exceptional Fault Diagnosis and Analysis</div>
<div>Embedded Programing in C</div>
<div>Version Control</div>
<div>Static Analysis / Code Metrics</div>
<div>Microprocessors 8, 16 &amp; 32 bit</div>
<div>Low Level Drivers for External Hardware / CPU Peripherals or Embedded Application Development</div>
<div>Communication &ndash; Spoken/Written/Technical English must be of a minimum of IELTS 7 or SELT B1</div>
<div></div><div>Additional points that would be an advantage</div>
<div>Knowledge of Real Time Control</div>
<div>Experience of Software Architecture and Detailed Design</div>
<div>Ability to travel freely (some customers are based in US / EU)</div>
<div>Familiarity of working within MISRA C rules</div>
<div>Working experience of AUTOSAR architecture</div>
<div>Programing: Windows/Linux, Visual Basic, C++, high level structured languages</div>
<div>Simple Electronic Design: Analogue / Digital</div>
<div>Control of Graphic Displays</div>
<div>Communications Protocols: Serial, CAN, LIN, Diagnostic, Ethernet</div>
<div>Use Vector Vehicle Networking Tools such as CANoe/CANalyser</div>
<div>Design / Modelling experience (For example: UML, Matlab, Simulink, Rhapsody or Targetlink)</div>
<div>Experience of Graphics Processors &amp; Driving TFT displays</div>
<div>Knowledge of CMMI / SPICE / ASPICE process frameworks</div>
<div>Practical experience of working to ISO26262 ASIL-B or similar</div>

<p></p><div>Pektron Group Ltd is searching for an Embedded Software Engineer who will be responsible for writing software for a range of bespoke products.</div>
<div></div><div>Our team:</div>
<div>Our Engineering attitude is confident and &ldquo;can do&rdquo; and with solid research and a lot of intuition we nearly always succeed.</div>
<div></div><div>Nearly all of our code is written in C, mainly because it&rsquo;s the most widely available language for the variety of 8, 16, 32 bit micros we use on our boards and we&rsquo;re good at it! We pride ourselves on efficient reliable software and we mix our hardware and software teams together so that we can get the most out of our micros and we get it right first time. All of our code is collaboratively developed with our peers, so you get to learn from the people that know that technology best.</div>
<div></div><div>We are geeks and proud! We love engineering and our lunchtime conversations are made up of 3D printing, power generation, hyper cars (we sometimes get to play with these), electric vehicles (we&rsquo;ve worked on some of these too) and any other areas of science and technology.</div>
<div></div><div>Last year we started developing our Application code using model based design using the Matlab toolchain, allowing us to spend less time on coding and more time thinking about good quality architecture and design and let the tools (when driven correctly) do the coding! Obviously, there&rsquo;s always plenty of code to be written and we continue to do low and middle level software the traditional way.</div>
<div></div><div>You:</div>
<div>You will be a highly motivated and self-managing Embedded Software Engineer with preferably the experience of working in a customer facing, commercial environment. You will have a highly developed, structured approach to design and the ability to compose a design rationale, along with good technical writing skills and a willingness to work within our collaboratively developed software design ethics and style.</div>
<div></div><div>The role:</div>
<div>You will be working within the Software Development Team which is part a multi-disciplined engineering team, consisting of Mechanical, Electronic and Firmware Engineers (approx. 60 in total). New business is primarily focussed in the high performance and luxury car markets; however Pektron designs and manufactures a wide range of products for Gas, Automotive, Safety and Consumer industries. You will have the opportunity to write software for interesting and diverse projects as well as specify tools, requirements and drive the software discipline within the company, and to be involved in every aspect of the product lifecycle from quotation, concept, design, and validation through to manufacture.</div>
<div></div><div>Recent projects include:</div>
<div>Design and manufacture of advanced body control systems including passive keys and active suspension systems for high performance vehicles.</div>
<div>Developing advanced instrument clusters, passive entry systems, body and chassis control systems for major OEM clients in the automotive, agricultural and construction sectors.</div>
<div></div><div>Experience and skills required:</div>
<div>Exceptional Fault Diagnosis and Analysis</div>
<div>Embedded Programing in C</div>
<div>Version Control</div>
<div>Static Analysis / Code Metrics</div>
<div>Microprocessors 8, 16 &amp; 32 bit</div>
<div>Low Level Drivers for External Hardware / CPU Peripherals or Embedded Application Development</div>
<div>Communication &ndash; Spoken/Written/Technical English must be of a minimum of IELTS 7 or SELT B1</div>
<div></div><div>Additional points that would be an advantage</div>
<div>Knowledge of Real Time Control</div>
<div>Experience of Software Architecture and Detailed Design</div>
<div>Ability to travel freely (some customers are based in US / EU)</div>
<div>Familiarity of working within MISRA C rules</div>
<div>Working experience of AUTOSAR architecture</div>
<div>Programing: Windows/Linux, Visual Basic, C++, high level structured languages</div>
<div>Simple Electronic Design: Analogue / Digital</div>
<div>Control of Graphic Displays</div>
<div>Communications Protocols: Serial, CAN, LIN, Diagnostic, Ethernet</div>
<div>Use Vector Vehicle Networking Tools such as CANoe/CANalyser</div>
<div>Design / Modelling experience (For example: UML, Matlab, Simulink, Rhapsody or Targetlink)</div>
<div>Experience of Graphics Processors &amp; Driving TFT displays</div>
<div>Knowledge of CMMI / SPICE / ASPICE process frameworks</div>
<div>Practical experience of working to ISO26262 ASIL-B or similar</div>

<p></p><div>Pektron Group Ltd is searching for an Embedded Software Engineer who will be responsible for writing software for a range of bespoke products.</div>
<div></div><div>Our team:</div>
<div>Our Engineering attitude is confident and &ldquo;can do&rdquo; and with solid research and a lot of intuition we nearly always succeed.</div>
<div></div><div>Nearly all of our code is written in C, mainly because it&rsquo;s the most widely available language for the variety of 8, 16, 32 bit micros we use on our boards and we&rsquo;re good at it! We pride ourselves on efficient reliable software and we mix our hardware and software teams together so that we can get the most out of our micros and we get it right first time. All of our code is collaboratively developed with our peers, so you get to learn from the people that know that technology best.</div>
<div></div><div>We are geeks and proud! We love engineering and our lunchtime conversations are made up of 3D printing, power generation, hyper cars (we sometimes get to play with these), electric vehicles (we&rsquo;ve worked on some of these too) and any other areas of science and technology.</div>
<div></div><div>Last year we started developing our Application code using model based design using the Matlab toolchain, allowing us to spend less time on coding and more time thinking about good quality architecture and design and let the tools (when driven correctly) do the coding! Obviously, there&rsquo;s always plenty of code to be written and we continue to do low and middle level software the traditional way.</div>
<div></div><div>You:</div>
<div>You will be a highly motivated and self-managing Embedded Software Engineer with preferably the experience of working in a customer facing, commercial environment.

<p></p><div>Pektron Group Ltd is searching for an Embedded Software Engineer who will be responsible for writing software for a range of bespoke products.</div>
<div></div><div>Our team:</div>
<div>Our Engineering attitude is confident and &ldquo;can do&rdquo; and with solid research and a lot of intuition we nearly always succeed.</div>
<div></div><div>Nearly all of our code is written in C, mainly because it&rsquo;s the most widely available language for the variety of 8, 16, 32 bit micros we use on our boards and we&rsquo;re good at it! We pride ourselves on efficient reliable software and we mix our hardware and software teams together so that we can get the most out of our micros and we get it right first time. All of our code is collaboratively developed with our peers, so you get to learn from the people that know that technology best.</div>
<div></div><div>We are geeks and proud! We love engineering and our lunchtime conversations are made up of 3D printing, power generation, hyper cars (we sometimes get to play with these), electric vehicles (we&rsquo;ve worked on some of these too) and any other areas of science and technology.</div>
<div></div><div>Last year we started developing our Application code using model based design using the Matlab toolchain, allowing us to spend less time on coding and more time thinking about good quality architecture and design and let the tools (when driven correctly) do the coding! Obviously, there&rsquo;s always plenty of code to be written and we continue to do low and middle level software the traditional way.</div>
<div></div><div>You:</div>
<div>You will be a highly motivated and self-managing Embedded Software Engineer with preferably the experience of working in a customer facing, commercial environment. You will have a highly developed, structured approach to design and the ability to compose a design rationale, along with good technical writing skills and a willingness to work within our collaboratively developed software design ethics and style.</div>
<div></div><div>The role:</div>
<div>You will be working within the Software Development Team which is part a multi-disciplined engineering team, consisting of Mechanical, Electronic and Firmware Engineers (approx. 60 in total). New business is primarily focussed in the high performance and luxury car markets; however Pektron designs and manufactures a wide range of products for Gas, Automotive, Safety and Consumer industries. You will have the opportunity to write software for interesting and diverse projects as well as specify tools, requirements and drive the software discipline within the company, and to be involved in every aspect of the product lifecycle from quotation, concept, design, and validation through to manufacture.</div>
<div></div><div>Recent projects include:</div>
<div>Design and manufacture of advanced body control systems including passive keys and active suspension systems for high performance vehicles.</div>
<div>Developing advanced instrument clusters, passive entry systems, body and chassis control systems for major OEM clients in the automotive, agricultural and construction sectors.</div>
<div></div><div>Experience and skills required:</div>
<div>Exceptional Fault Diagnosis and Analysis</div>
<div>Embedded Programing in C</div>
<div>Version Control</div>
<div>Static Analysis / Code Metrics</div>
<div>Microprocessors 8, 16 &amp; 32 bit</div>
<div>Low Level Drivers for External Hardware / CPU Peripherals or Embedded Application Development</div>
<div>Communication &ndash; Spoken/Written/Technical English must be of a minimum of IELTS 7 or SELT B1</div>
<div></div><div>Additional points that would be an advantage</div>
<div>Knowledge of Real Time Control</div>
<div>Experience of Software Architecture and Detailed Design</div>
<div>Ability to travel freely (some customers are based in US / EU)</div>
<div>Familiarity of working within MISRA C rules</div>
<div>Working experience of AUTOSAR architecture</div>
<div>Programing: Windows/Linux, Visual Basic, C++, high level structured languages</div>
<div>Simple Electronic Design: Analogue / Digital</div>
<div>Control of Graphic Displays</div>
<div>Communications Protocols: Serial, CAN, LIN, Diagnostic, Ethernet</div>

<div>Design / Modelling experience (For example: UML, Matlab, Simulink, Rhapsody or Targetlink)</div>
<div>Experience of Graphics Processors &amp; Driving TFT displays</div>
<div>Knowledge of CMMI / SPICE / ASPICE process frameworks</div>
<div>Practical experience of working to ISO26262 ASIL-B or similar</div>

<p></p><div>Pektron Group Ltd is searching for an Embedded Software Engineer who will be responsible for writing software for a range of bespoke products.</div>
<div></div><div>Our team:</div>
<div>Our Engineering attitude is confident and &ldquo;can do&rdquo; and with solid research and a lot of intuition we nearly always succeed.</div>
<div></div><div>Nearly all of our code is written in C, mainly because it&rsquo;s the most widely available language for the variety of 8, 16, 32 bit micros we use on our boards and we&rsquo;re good at it! We pride ourselves on efficient reliable software and we mix our hardware and software teams together so that we can get the most out of our micros and we get it right first time. All of our code is collaboratively developed with our peers, so you get to learn from the people that know that technology best.</div>
<div></div><div>We are geeks and proud! We love engineering and our lunchtime conversations are made up of 3D printing, power generation, hyper cars (we sometimes get to play with these), electric vehicles (we&rsquo;ve worked on some of these too) and any other areas of science and technology.</div>
<div></div><div>Last year we started developing our Application code using model based design using the Matlab toolchain, allowing us to spend less time on coding and more time thinking about good quality architecture and design and let the tools (when driven correctly) do the coding! Obviously, there&rsquo;s always plenty of code to be written and we continue to do low and middle level software the traditional way.</div>
<div></div><div>You:</div>
<div>You will be a highly motivated and self-managing Embedded Software Engineer with preferably the experience of working in a customer facing, commercial environment. You will have a highly developed, structured approach to design and the ability to compose a design rationale, along with good technical writing skills and a willingness to work within our collaboratively developed software design ethics and style.</div>
<div></div><div>The role:</div>
<div>You will be working within the Software Development Team which is part a multi-disciplined engineering team, consisting of Mechanical, Electronic and Firmware Engineers (approx. 60 in total). New business is primarily focussed in the high performance and luxury car markets; however Pektron designs and manufactures a wide range of products for Gas, Automotive, Safety and Consumer industries. You will have the opportunity to write software for interesting and diverse projects as well as specify tools, requirements and drive the software discipline within the company, and to be involved in every aspect of the product lifecycle from quotation, concept, design, and validation through to manufacture.</div>
<div></div><div>Recent projects include:</div>
<div>Design and manufacture of advanced body control systems including passive keys and active suspension systems for high performance vehicles.</div>
<div>Developing advanced instrument clusters, passive entry systems, body and chassis control systems for major OEM clients in the automotive, agricultural and construction sectors.</div>
<div></div><div>Experience and skills required:</div>
<div>Exceptional Fault Diagnosis and Analysis</div>
<div>Embedded Programing in C</div>
<div>Version Control</div>
<div>Static Analysis / Code Metrics</div>
<div>Microprocessors 8, 16 &amp; 32 bit</div>
<div>Low Level Drivers for External Hardware / CPU Peripherals or Embedded Application Development</div>
<div>Communication &ndash; Spoken/Written/Technical English must be of a minimum of IELTS 7 or SELT B1</div>
<div></div><div>Additional points that would be an advantage</div>
<div>Knowledge of Real Time Control</div>
<div>Experience of Software Architecture and Detailed Design</div>
<div>Ability to travel freely (some customers are based in US / EU)</div>
<div>Familiarity of working within MISRA C rules</div>
<div>Working experience of AUTOSAR architecture</div>
<div>Programing: Windows/Linux, Visual Basic, C++, high level structured languages</div>
<div>Simple Electronic Design: Analogue / Digital</div>
<div>Control of Graphic Displays</div>
<div>Communications Protocols: Serial, CAN, LIN, Diagnostic, Ethernet</div>
<div>Use Vector Vehicle Networking Tools such as CANoe/CANalyser</div>
<div>Design / Modelling experience (For example: UML, Matlab, Simulink, Rhapsody or Targetlink)</div>
<div>Experience of Graphics Processors &amp; Driving TFT displays</div>
<div>Knowledge of CMMI / SPICE / ASPICE process frameworks</div>
<div>Practical experience of working to ISO26262 ASIL-B or similar</div>
<div></div>

<p></p><div>Pektron Group Ltd is searching for an Embedded Software Engineer who will be responsible for writing software for a range of bespoke products.</div>
<div></div><div>Our team:</div>
<div>Our Engineering attitude is confident and &ldquo;can do&rdquo; and with solid research and a lot of intuition we nearly always succeed.</div>
<div></div><div>Nearly all of our code is written in C, mainly because it&rsquo;s the most widely available language for the variety of 8, 16, 32 bit micros we use on our boards and we&rsquo;re good at it! We pride ourselves on efficient reliable software and we mix our hardware and software teams together so that we can get the most out of our micros and we get it right first time. All of our code is collaboratively developed with our peers, so you get to learn from the people that know that technology best.</div>
<div></div><div>We are geeks and proud! We love engineering and our lunchtime conversations are made up of 3D printing, power generation, hyper cars (we sometimes get to play with these), electric vehicles (we&rsquo;ve worked on some of these too) and any other areas of science and technology.</div>
<div></div><div>Last year we started developing our Application code using model based design using the Matlab toolchain, allowing us to spend less time on coding and more time thinking about good quality architecture and design and let the tools (when driven correctly) do the coding! Obviously, there&rsquo;s always plenty of code to be written and we continue to do low and middle level software the traditional way.</div>
<div></div><div>You:</div>
<div>You will be a highly motivated and self-managing Embedded Software Engineer with preferably the experience of working in a customer facing, commercial environment. You will have a highly developed, structured approach to design and the ability to compose a design rationale, along with good technical writing skills and a willingness to work within our collaboratively developed software design ethics and style.</div>
<div></div><div>The role:</div>
<div>You will be working within the Software Development Team which is part a multi-disciplined engineering team, consisting of Mechanical, Electronic and Firmware Engineers (approx. 60 in total). New business is primarily focussed in the high performance and luxury car markets; however Pektron designs and manufactures a wide range of products for Gas, Automotive, Safety and Consumer industries. You will have the opportunity to write software for interesting and diverse projects as well as specify tools, requirements and drive the software discipline within the company, and to be involved in every aspect of the product lifecycle from quotation, concept, design, and validation through to manufacture.</div>
<div></div><div>Recent projects include:</div>
<div>Design and manufacture of advanced body control systems including passive keys and active suspension systems for high performance vehicles.</div>
<div>Developing advanced instrument clusters, passive entry systems, body and chassis control systems for major OEM clients in the automotive, agricultural and construction sectors.</div>
<div></div><div>Experience and skills required:</div>
<div>Exceptional Fault Diagnosis and Analysis</div>
<div>Embedded Programing in C</div>
<div>Version Control</div>
<div>Static Analysis / Code Metrics</div>
<div>Microprocessors 8, 16 &amp; 32 bit</div>
<div>Low Level Drivers for External Hardware / CPU Peripherals or Embedded Application Development</div>
<div>Communication &ndash; Spoken/Written/Technical English must be of a minimum of IELTS 7 or SELT B1</div>
<div></div><div>Additional points that would be an advantage</div>
<div>Knowledge of Real Time Control</div>
<div>Experience of Software Architecture and Detailed Design</div>
<div>Ability to travel freely (some customers are based in US / EU)</div>
<div>Familiarity of working within MISRA C rules</div>
<div>Working experience of AUTOSAR architecture</div>
<div>Programing: Windows/Linux, Visual Basic, C++, high level structured languages</div>
<div>Simple Electronic Design: Analogue / Digital</div>
<div>Control of Graphic Displays</div>
<div>Communications Protocols: Serial, CAN, LIN, Diagnostic, Ethernet</div>
<div>Use Vector Vehicle Networking Tools such as CANoe/CANalyser</div>
<div>Design / Modelling experience (For example: UML, Matlab, Simulink, Rhapsody or Targetlink)</div>
<div>Experience of Graphics Processors &amp; Driving TFT displays</div>
<div>Knowledge of CMMI / SPICE / ASPICE process frameworks</div>
<div>Practical experience of working to ISO26262 ASIL-B or similar</div>

</p><p>We take an hybrid-agile approach to product development, forgoing the traditional vertical structure of management, meaning that even our newest developers will be given opportunities and encouraged to lead and learn.
</p><p><b>We're looking for software engineers who share our passion for code</b>. We're primarily a PHP team, but we're strong believers that language doesn't matter - the kind of software engineer we're looking for will be able to create magic, regardless of the language however previous experience in our tools will be a bonus.</p>
<p>
We use an array of tools, technologies and frameworks including:</p>
<ul>
<li>PHP 8.2</li>
<li>Symfony LTS releases including: 5.4 and 6.4</li>
<li>MySQL
</li><li>React</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>PHPUnit
</li><li>Git &amp; GitHub</li>
<li>YouTrack</li>
<li>TeamCity
</li><li>PHPStorm
</li></ul><p>Exposure to these tools is always favourable, but as an engineer we're sure you'll relish the opportunity to learn new technology and use new tools. We release multiple times a day through a fully automated release pipeline, this is development in the fast lane and there is no room to dawdle.</p>
<p>
Ultimately, we want people who have a compulsion to solve problems, that thrive at being challenged, crave knowledge, aspire to be the best, a desire to deliver value, and most of all, people who have a real passion for the work. <i>People just like us</i>.</p>

<p></p><div>Pektron Group Ltd is searching for an Embedded Software Engineer who will be responsible for writing software for a range of bespoke products.</div>
<div></div><div>Our team:</div>
<div>Our Engineering attitude is confident and &ldquo;can do&rdquo; and with solid research and a lot of intuition we nearly always succeed.</div>
<div></div><div>Nearly all of our code is written in C, mainly because it&rsquo;s the most widely available language for the variety of 8, 16, 32 bit micros we use on our boards and we&rsquo;re good at it! We pride ourselves on efficient reliable software and we mix our hardware and software teams together so that we can get the most out of our micros and we get it right first time. All of our code is collaboratively developed with our peers, so you get to learn from the people that know that technology best.</div>
<div></div><div>We are geeks and proud! We love engineering and our lunchtime conversations are made up of 3D printing, power generation, hyper cars (we sometimes get to play with these), electric vehicles (we&rsquo;ve worked on some of these too) and any other areas of science and technology.</div>
<div></div><div>Last year we started developing our Application code using model based design using the Matlab toolchain, allowing us to spend less time on coding and more time thinking about good quality architecture and design and let the tools (when driven correctly) do the coding! Obviously, there&rsquo;s always plenty of code to be written and we continue to do low and middle level software the traditional way.</div>
<div></div><div>You:</div>
<div>You will be a highly motivated and self-managing Embedded Software Engineer with preferably the experience of working in a customer facing, commercial environment. You will have a highly developed, structured approach to design and the ability to compose a design rationale, along with good technical writing skills and a willingness to work within our collaboratively developed software design ethics and style.</div>
<div></div><div>The role:</div>
<div>You will be working within the Software Development Team which is part a multi-disciplined engineering team, consisting of Mechanical, Electronic and Firmware Engineers (approx. 60 in total). New business is primarily focussed in the high performance and luxury car markets; however Pektron designs and manufactures a wide range of products for Gas, Automotive, Safety and Consumer industries. You will have the opportunity to write software for interesting and diverse projects as well as specify tools, requirements and drive the software discipline within the company, and to be involved in every aspect of the product lifecycle from quotation, concept, design, and validation through to manufacture.</div>
<div></div><div>Recent projects include:</div>
<div>Design and manufacture of advanced body control systems including passive keys and active suspension systems for high performance vehicles.</div>
<div>Developing advanced instrument clusters, passive entry systems, body and chassis control systems for major OEM clients in the automotive, agricultural and construction sectors.</div>
<div></div><div>Experience and skills required:</div>
<div>Exceptional Fault Diagnosis and Analysis</div>
<div>Embedded Programing in C</div>
<div>Version Control</div>
<div>Static Analysis / Code Metrics</div>
<div>Microprocessors 8, 16 &amp; 32 bit</div>
<div>Low Level Drivers for External Hardware / CPU Peripherals or Embedded Application Development</div>
<div>Communication &ndash; Spoken/Written/Technical English must be of a minimum of IELTS 7 or SELT B1</div>
<div></div><div>Additional points that would be an advantage</div>
<div>Knowledge of Real Time Control</div>
<div>Experience of Software Architecture and Detailed Design</div>
<div>Ability to travel freely (some customers are based in US / EU)</div>
<div>Familiarity of working within MISRA C rules</div>
<div>Working experience of AUTOSAR architecture</div>

<div>Control of Graphic Displays</div>
<div>Communications Protocols: Serial, CAN, LIN, Diagnostic, Ethernet</div>

<div>Design / Modelling experience (For example: UML, Matlab, Simulink, Rhapsody or Targetlink)</div>
<div>Experience of Graphics Processors &amp; Driving TFT displays</div>
<div>Knowledge of CMMI / SPICE / ASPICE process frameworks</div>
<div>Practical experience of working to ISO26262 ASIL-B or similar</div>

<p></p><div>Pektron Group Ltd is searching for an Embedded Software Engineer who will be responsible for writing software for a range of bespoke products.</div>
<div></div><div>Our team:</div>
<div>Our Engineering attitude is confident and &ldquo;can do&rdquo; and with solid research and a lot of intuition we nearly always succeed.</div>
<div></div><div>Nearly all of our code is written in C, mainly because it&rsquo;s the most widely available language for the variety of 8, 16, 32 bit micros we use on our boards and we&rsquo;re good at it! We pride ourselves on efficient reliable software and we mix our hardware and software teams together so that we can get the most out of our micros and we get it right first time. All of our code is collaboratively developed with our peers, so you get to learn from the people that know that technology best.</div>
<div></div><div>We are geeks and proud! We love engineering and our lunchtime conversations are made up of 3D printing, power generation, hyper cars (we sometimes get to play with these), electric vehicles (we&rsquo;ve worked on some of these too) and any other areas of science and technology.</div>
<div></div><div>Last year we started developing our Application code using model based design using the Matlab toolchain, allowing us to spend less time on coding and more time thinking about good quality architecture and design and let the tools (when driven correctly) do the coding! Obviously, there&rsquo;s always plenty of code to be written and we continue to do low and middle level software the traditional way.</div>
<div></div><div>You:</div>
<div>You will be a highly motivated and self-managing Embedded Software Engineer with preferably the experience of working in a customer facing, commercial environment. You will have a highly developed, structured approach to design and the ability to compose a design rationale, along with good technical writing skills and a willingness to work within our collaboratively developed software design ethics and style.</div>
<div></div><div>The role:</div>
<div>You will be working within the Software Development Team which is part a multi-disciplined engineering team, consisting of Mechanical, Electronic and Firmware Engineers (approx. 60 in total). New business is primarily focussed in the high performance and luxury car markets; however Pektron designs and manufactures a wide range of products for Gas, Automotive, Safety and Consumer industries. You will have the opportunity to write software for interesting and diverse projects as well as specify tools, requirements and drive the software discipline within the company, and to be involved in every aspect of the product lifecycle from quotation, concept, design, and validation through to manufacture.</div>
<div></div><div>Recent projects include:</div>
<div>Design and manufacture of advanced body control systems including passive keys and active suspension systems for high performance vehicles.</div>
<div>Developing advanced instrument clusters, passive entry systems, body and chassis control systems for major OEM clients in the automotive, agricultural and construction sectors.</div>
<div></div><div>Experience and skills required:</div>
<div>Exceptional Fault Diagnosis and Analysis</div>
<div>Embedded Programing in C</div>
<div>Version Control</div>
<div>Static Analysis / Code Metrics</div>
<div>Microprocessors 8, 16 &amp; 32 bit</div>
<div>Low Level Drivers for External Hardware / CPU Peripherals or Embedded Application Development</div>
<div>Communication &ndash; Spoken/Written/Technical English must be of a minimum of IELTS 7 or SELT B1</div>
<div></div><div>Additional points that would be an advantage</div>
<div>Knowledge of Real Time Control</div>
<div>Experience of Software Architecture and Detailed Design</div>
<div>Ability to travel freely (some customers are based in US / EU)</div>
<div>Familiarity of working within MISRA C rules</div>
<div>Working experience of AUTOSAR architecture</div>
<div>Programing: Windows/Linux, Visual Basic, C++, high level structured languages</div>
<div>Simple Electronic Design: Analogue / Digital</div>
<div>Control of Graphic Displays</div>
<div>Communications Protocols: Serial, CAN, LIN, Diagnostic, Ethernet</div>
<div>Use Vector Vehicle Networking Tools such as CANoe/CANalyser</div>
<div>Design / Modelling experience (For example: UML, Matlab, Simulink, Rhapsody or Targetlink)</div>
<div>Experience of Graphics Processors &amp; Driving TFT displays</div>
<div>Knowledge of CMMI / SPICE / ASPICE process frameworks</div>
<div>Practical experience of working to ISO26262 ASIL-B or similar</div>

<p></p><div>Pektron Group Ltd is searching for an Embedded Software Engineer who will be responsible for writing software for a range of bespoke products.</div>
<div></div><div>Our team:</div>
<div>Our Engineering attitude is confident and &ldquo;can do&rdquo; and with solid research and a lot of intuition we nearly always succeed.</div>
<div></div><div>Nearly all of our code is written in C, mainly because it&rsquo;s the most widely available language for the variety of 8, 16, 32 bit micros we use on our boards and we&rsquo;re good at it! We pride ourselves on efficient reliable software and we mix our hardware and software teams together so that we can get the most out of our micros and we get it right first time. All of our code is collaboratively developed with our peers, so you get to learn from the people that know that technology best.</div>
<div></div><div>We are geeks and proud! We love engineering and our lunchtime conversations are made up of 3D printing, power generation, hyper cars (we sometimes get to play with these), electric vehicles (we&rsquo;ve worked on some of these too) and any other areas of science and technology.</div>
<div></div><div>Last year we started developing our Application code using model based design using the Matlab toolchain, allowing us to spend less time on coding and more time thinking about good quality architecture and design and let the tools (when driven correctly) do the coding! Obviously, there&rsquo;s always plenty of code to be written and we continue to do low and middle level software the traditional way.</div>
<div></div><div>You:</div>
<div>You will be a highly motivated and self-managing Embedded Software Engineer with preferably the experience of working in a customer facing, commercial environment. You will have a highly developed, structured approach to design and the ability to compose a design rationale, along with good technical writing skills and a willingness to work within our collaboratively developed software design ethics and style.</div>
<div></div><div>The role:</div>
<div>You will be working within the Software Development Team which is part a multi-disciplined engineering team, consisting of Mechanical, Electronic and Firmware Engineers (approx. 60 in total). New business is primarily focussed in the high performance and luxury car markets; however Pektron designs and manufactures a wide range of products for Gas, Automotive, Safety and Consumer industries. You will have the opportunity to write software for interesting and diverse projects as well as specify tools, requirements and drive the software discipline within the company, and to be involved in every aspect of the product lifecycle from quotation, concept, design, and validation through to manufacture.</div>
<div></div><div>Recent projects include:</div>
<div>Design and manufacture of advanced body control systems including passive keys and active suspension systems for high performance vehicles.</div>
<div>Developing advanced instrument clusters, passive entry systems, body and chassis control systems for major OEM clients in the automotive, agricultural and construction sectors.</div>
<div></div><div>Experience and skills required:</div>
<div>Exceptional Fault Diagnosis and Analysis</div>
<div>Embedded Programing in C</div>
<div>Version Control</div>
<div>Static Analysis / Code Metrics</div>
<div>Microprocessors 8, 16 &amp; 32 bit</div>
<div>Low Level Drivers for External Hardware / CPU Peripherals or Embedded Application Development</div>
<div>Communication &ndash; Spoken/Written/Technical English must be of a minimum of IELTS 7 or SELT B1</div>
<div></div><div>Additional points that would be an advantage</div>
<div>Knowledge of Real Time Control</div>
<div>Experience of Software Architecture and Detailed Design</div>
<div>Ability to travel freely (some customers are based in US / EU)</div>
<div>Familiarity of working within MISRA C rules</div>
<div>Working experience of AUTOSAR architecture</div>
<div>Programing: Windows/Linux, Visual Basic, C++, high level structured languages</div>
<div>Simple Electronic Design: Analogue / Digital</div>
<div>Control of Graphic Displays</div>
<div>Communications Protocols: Serial, CAN, LIN, Diagnostic, Ethernet</div>
<div>Use Vector Vehicle Networking Tools such as CANoe/CANalyser</div>
<div>Design / Modelling experience (For example: UML, Matlab, Simulink, Rhapsody or Targetlink)</div>
<div>Experience of Graphics Processors &amp; Driving TFT displays</div>
<div>Knowledge of CMMI / SPICE / ASPICE process frameworks</div>
<div>Practical experience of working to ISO26262 ASIL-B or similar</div>

<p></p><div>Pektron Group Ltd is searching for an Embedded Software Engineer who will be responsible for writing software for a range of bespoke products.</div>
<div></div><div>Our team:</div>
<div>Our Engineering attitude is confident and &ldquo;can do&rdquo; and with solid research and a lot of intuition we nearly always succeed.</div>
<div></div><div>Nearly all of our code is written in C, mainly because it&rsquo;s the most widely available language for the variety of 8, 16, 32 bit micros we use on our boards and we&rsquo;re good at it! We pride ourselves on efficient reliable software and we mix our hardware and software teams together so that we can get the most out of our micros and we get it right first time. All of our code is collaboratively developed with our peers, so you get to learn from the people that know that technology best.</div>
<div></div><div>We are geeks and proud! We love engineering and our lunchtime conversations are made up of 3D printing, power generation, hyper cars (we sometimes get to play with these), electric vehicles (we&rsquo;ve worked on some of these too) and any other areas of science and technology.</div>
<div></div><div>Last year we started developing our Application code using model based design using the Matlab toolchain, allowing us to spend less time on coding and more time thinking about good quality architecture and design and let the tools (when driven correctly) do the coding! Obviously, there&rsquo;s always plenty of code to be written and we continue to do low and middle level software the traditional way.</div>
<div></div><div>You:</div>
<div>You will be a highly motivated and self-managing Embedded Software Engineer with preferably the experience of working in a customer facing, commercial environment. You will have a highly developed, structured approach to design and the ability to compose a design rationale, along with good technical writing skills and a willingness to work within our collaboratively developed software design ethics and style.</div>
<div></div><div>The role:</div>
<div>You will be working within the Software Development Team which is part a multi-disciplined engineering team, consisting of Mechanical, Electronic and Firmware Engineers (approx. 60 in total). New business is primarily focussed in the high performance and luxury car markets; however Pektron designs and manufactures a wide range of products for Gas, Automotive, Safety and Consumer industries. You will have the opportunity to write software for interesting and diverse projects as well as specify tools, requirements and drive the software discipline within the company, and to be involved in every aspect of the product lifecycle from quotation, concept, design, and validation through to manufacture.</div>
<div></div><div>Recent projects include:</div>
<div>Design and manufacture of advanced body control systems including passive keys and active suspension systems for high performance vehicles.</div>
<div>Developing advanced instrument clusters, passive entry systems, body and chassis control systems for major OEM clients in the automotive, agricultural and construction sectors.</div>
<div></div><div>Experience and skills required:</div>
<div>Exceptional Fault Diagnosis and Analysis</div>
<div>Embedded Programing in C</div>
<div>Version Control</div>
<div>Static Analysis / Code Metrics</div>
<div>Microprocessors 8, 16 &amp; 32 bit</div>
<div>Low Level Drivers for External Hardware / CPU Peripherals or Embedded Application Development</div>
<div>Communication &ndash; Spoken/Written/Technical English must be of a minimum of IELTS 7 or SELT B1</div>
<div></div><div>Additional points that would be an advantage</div>
<div>Knowledge of Real Time Control</div>
<div>Experience of Software Architecture and Detailed Design</div>
<div>Ability to travel freely (some customers are based in US / EU)</div>
<div>Familiarity of working within MISRA C rules</div>
<div>Working experience of AUTOSAR architecture</div>
<div>Programing: Windows/Linux, Visual Basic, C++, high level structured languages</div>
<div>Simple Electronic Design: Analogue / Digital</div>
<div>Control of Graphic Displays</div>
<div>Communications Protocols: Serial, CAN, LIN, Diagnostic, Ethernet</div>
<div>Use Vector Vehicle Networking Tools such as CANoe/CANalyser</div>
<div>Design / Modelling experience (For example: UML, Matlab, Simulink, Rhapsody or Targetlink)</div>
<div>Experience of Graphics Processors &amp; Driving TFT displays</div>
<div>Knowledge of CMMI / SPICE / ASPICE process frameworks</div>
<div>Practical experience of working to ISO26262 ASIL-B or similar</div>
<div></div>

<p></p><div>Pektron Group Ltd is searching for an Embedded Software Engineer who will be responsible for writing software for a range of bespoke products.</div>
<div></div><div>Our team:</div>
<div>Our Engineering attitude is confident and &ldquo;can do&rdquo; and with solid research and a lot of intuition we nearly always succeed.</div>
<div></div><div>Nearly all of our code is written in C, mainly because it&rsquo;s the most widely available language for the variety of 8, 16, 32 bit micros we use on our boards and we&rsquo;re good at it! We pride ourselves on efficient reliable software and we mix our hardware and software teams together so that we can get the most out of our micros and we get it right first time. All of our code is collaboratively developed with our peers, so you get to learn from the people that know that technology best.</div>
<div></div><div>We are geeks and proud! We love engineering and our lunchtime conversations are made up of 3D printing, power generation, hyper cars (we sometimes get to play with these), electric vehicles (we&rsquo;ve worked on some of these too) and any other areas of science and technology.</div>
<div></div><div>Last year we started developing our Application code using model based design using the Matlab toolchain, allowing us to spend less time on coding and more time thinking about good quality architecture and design and let the tools (when driven correctly) do the coding! Obviously, there&rsquo;s always plenty of code to be written and we continue to do low and middle level software the traditional way.</div>
<div></div><div>You:</div>
<div>You will be a highly motivated and self-managing Embedded Software Engineer with preferably the experience of working in a customer facing, commercial environment. You will have a highly developed, structured approach to design and the ability to compose a design rationale, along with good technical writing skills and a willingness to work within our collaboratively developed software design ethics and style.</div>
<div></div><div>The role:</div>
<div>You will be working within the Software Development Team which is part a multi-disciplined engineering team, consisting of Mechanical, Electronic and Firmware Engineers (approx. 60 in total). New business is primarily focussed in the high performance and luxury car markets; however Pektron designs and manufactures a wide range of products for Gas, Automotive, Safety and Consumer industries. You will have the opportunity to write software for interesting and diverse projects as well as specify tools, requirements and drive the software discipline within the company, and to be involved in every aspect of the product lifecycle from quotation, concept, design, and validation through to manufacture.</div>
<div></div><div>Recent projects include:</div>
<div>Design and manufacture of advanced body control systems including passive keys and active suspension systems for high performance vehicles.</div>
<div>Developing advanced instrument clusters, passive entry systems, body and chassis control systems for major OEM clients in the automotive, agricultural and construction sectors.</div>
<div></div><div>Experience and skills required:</div>
<div>Exceptional Fault Diagnosis and Analysis</div>
<div>Embedded Programing in C</div>
<div>Version Control</div>
<div>Static Analysis / Code Metrics</div>
<div>Microprocessors 8, 16 &amp; 32 bit</div>
<div>Low Level Drivers for External Hardware / CPU Peripherals or Embedded Application Development</div>
<div>Communication &ndash; Spoken/Written/Technical English must be of a minimum of IELTS 7 or SELT B1</div>
<div></div><div>Additional points that would be an advantage</div>
<div>Knowledge of Real Time Control</div>
<div>Experience of Software Architecture and Detailed Design</div>
<div>Ability to travel freely (some customers are based in US / EU)</div>
<div>Familiarity of working within MISRA C rules</div>
<div>Working experience of AUTOSAR architecture</div>
<div>Programing: Windows/Linux, Visual Basic, C++, high level structured languages</div>
<div>Simple Electronic Design: Analogue / Digital</div>
<div>Control of Graphic Displays</div>
<div>Communications Protocols: Serial, CAN, LIN, Diagnostic, Ethernet</div>
<div>Use Vector Vehicle Networking Tools such as CANoe/CANalyser</div>
<div>Design / Modelling experience (For example: UML, Matlab, Simulink, Rhapsody or Targetlink)</div>
<div>Experience of Graphics Processors &amp; Driving TFT displays</div>
<div>Knowledge of CMMI / SPICE / ASPICE process frameworks</div>
<div>Practical experience of working to ISO26262 ASIL-B or similar</div>
