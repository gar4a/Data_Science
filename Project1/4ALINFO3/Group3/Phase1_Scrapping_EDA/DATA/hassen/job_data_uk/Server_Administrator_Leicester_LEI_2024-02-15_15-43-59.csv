I'm looking for an experienced SQL Server Database Administrator to join a 3 x Microsoft Gold Certified Managed Services Provider, who specialise in DBA and development work. They are a relatively small and close-knit company, who operate on a fully-remote basis, with quarterly meet ups to get together, socialise, and celebrate their successes!<br>

I'm looking for an experienced SQL Server Database Administrator to join a 3 x Microsoft Gold Certified Managed Services Provider, who specialise in DBA and development work. They are a relatively small and close-knit company, who operate on a fully-remote basis, with quarterly meet ups to get together, socialise, and celebrate their successes!<br>

I'm looking for an experienced SQL Server Database Administrator to join a 3 x Microsoft Gold Certified Managed Services Provider, who specialise in DBA and development work. They are a relatively small and close-knit company, who operate on a fully-remote basis, with quarterly meet ups to get together, socialise, and celebrate their successes!<br>

I'm looking for an experienced SQL Server Database Administrator to join a 3 x Microsoft Gold Certified Managed Services Provider, who specialise in DBA and development work. They are a relatively small and close-knit company, who operate on a fully-remote basis, with quarterly meet ups to get together, socialise, and celebrate their successes!<br>
