Ten weeks to discover what our business is about.
</b></p><p><b>That's one good thing.</b></p><p>
At Capital One, we're on a mission: to change the world of credit for better &ndash; one small, good thing at a time. You might think of us as a credit card company. But the truth is, we're just as much a technology business. And we're here to make a positive difference &ndash; to our customers, our colleagues and society as a whole.</p><p></p><p>
One of the happy consequences of making finance easier for our customers is that it makes Capital One an inspiring place to launch your career. Join us, and you can gain valuable experience as you take on meaningful work in collaborative teams.</p><p></p><p>
We are committed to creating a level playing field and seek to create teams that are representative of our customers and the communities we serve. We&rsquo;d love to hear from you if you identify with an under-represented group in our industry and are particularly keen to hear from women, the LGBTQ+ community and ethnic minority candidates.</p><p></p><p>
We want to help you grow. That&rsquo;s why we invest heavily in your learning and development. We&rsquo;ve got a great track record of hiring graduates and enabling them to reach their full potential. Just look at our CEO, Lucy Hagues. She started as a graduate and now leads the UK business. And that&rsquo;s just one of many success stories.</p><p></p><p><b><br>
Strategy Analysts at Capital One</b></p><p>
You&rsquo;ll come at problems from fresh new angles. You&rsquo;ll bring great ideas (and you won't be afraid to share them). You&rsquo;ll keep our whole organisation on the right track. You'll use insightful data analysis along with critical judgement skills to solve problems and drive change that leads the whole industry forwards.</p><p></p><p>
At Capital One, we&rsquo;re always looking at ways to boost our business and give our customers a better experience. On this ten-week programme, you&rsquo;ll take a bird&rsquo;s eye view of our business, and help us find new ways to improve every aspect of what we do. Expect great training as you take on real projects with support from the team around you. You&rsquo;ll even get to meet our CEO, Lucy Hagues, who started on our Graduate Programme, and now heads up the UK business.</p><p></p><p>
And it isn&rsquo;t just about honing your professional skills. There's plenty of scope for personal development too. You'll be assigned a manager, mentor and buddy to support and advise you along the way. You can also get involved in social events run by our dedicated GradComms team or give back to the community through any of our corporate social responsibility initiatives.</p><p></p><p><b>
What will you need?</b></p><p>
To start with, you need to be in the penultimate year of your studies. The subject of your degree is not important, but you will need an aptitude for maths, along with an inquisitive mindset and a creative approach to problem-solving. You should also be keen to develop your skills in coding and analysis.</p><p></p><p>
Above all, we&rsquo;re looking for people who thrive in a collaborative environment, which means working well with others, while also being focused on growth and development &ndash; yours and ours.</p><p></p><p><b>
What&rsquo;s in it for you</b></p><ul><li><p>

The Recruitment Process</b></p><p>
To ensure a flexible and accessible process, every stage will be conducted virtually. You'll also have a dedicated recruiter to support you throughout and answer any questions you might have.</p><p></p><p>
Step 1: After your initial application, if you meet the hiring criteria you will be sent out online testing to complete, which consists of a situational and strengths, and a numerical and verbal reasoning assessment.</p><p></p><p>
Step 2: Next up, you will be invited to complete a one way video interview.</p><p></p><p>
Step 3: You&rsquo;ll get to (virtually) meet with one of our Strategy Analysts to complete a case study interview.</p><p></p><p>
Step 4: The assessment day, which consists of a group activity, case study and individual interview, and if successful we&rsquo;ll offer you a place on the programme!</p><p></p><p><b>

At Capital One, we're on a mission: to change the world of credit for better &ndash; one small, good thing at a time. You might think of us as a credit card company. But the truth is, we're just as much a technology business. And we're here to make a positive difference &ndash; to our customers, our colleagues and society as a whole.</p><p></p><p>
One of the happy consequences of making finance easier for our customers is that it makes Capital One an inspiring place to launch your career. Join us, and you can gain valuable experience as you take on meaningful work in collaborative teams.</p><p></p><p>

We want to help you grow. That&rsquo;s why we invest heavily in your learning and development. We&rsquo;ve got a great track record of hiring graduates and enabling them to reach their full potential. Just look at our CEO, Lucy Hagues. She started as a graduate and now leads the UK business.

You&rsquo;ll even get to meet our CEO, Lucy Hagues, who started on our Graduate Programme, and now heads up the UK business.</p><p></p><p>
And it isn&rsquo;t just about honing your professional skills. There's plenty of scope for personal development too. You'll be assigned a manager, mentor and buddy to support and advise you along the way. You can also get involved in social events run by our dedicated GradComms team or give back to the community through any of our corporate social responsibility initiatives.</p><p></p><p><b>
What will you need?</b></p><p>

Ten weeks to discover what our business is about.
</b></p><p><b>That's one good thing.</b></p><p>
At Capital One, we're on a mission: to change the world of credit for better &ndash; one small, good thing at a time. You might think of us as a credit card company. But the truth is, we're just as much a technology business. And we're here to make a positive difference &ndash; to our customers, our colleagues and society as a whole.</p><p></p><p>
One of the happy consequences of making finance easier for our customers is that it makes Capital One an inspiring place to launch your career. Join us, and you can gain valuable experience as you take on meaningful work in collaborative teams.</p><p></p><p>
We are committed to creating a level playing field and seek to create teams that are representative of our customers and the communities we serve. We&rsquo;d love to hear from you if you identify with an under-represented group in our industry and are particularly keen to hear from women, the LGBTQ+ community and ethnic minority candidates.</p><p></p><p>
We want to help you grow. That&rsquo;s why we invest heavily in your learning and development. We&rsquo;ve got a great track record of hiring graduates and enabling them to reach their full potential. Just look at our CEO, Lucy Hagues. She started as a graduate and now leads the UK business. And that&rsquo;s just one of many success stories.</p><p></p><p><b><br>
Strategy Analysts at Capital One</b></p><p>
You&rsquo;ll come at problems from fresh new angles. You&rsquo;ll bring great ideas (and you won't be afraid to share them). You&rsquo;ll keep our whole organisation on the right track. You'll use insightful data analysis along with critical judgement skills to solve problems and drive change that leads the whole industry forwards.</p><p></p><p>
At Capital One, we&rsquo;re always looking at ways to boost our business and give our customers a better experience. On this ten-week programme, you&rsquo;ll take a bird&rsquo;s eye view of our business, and help us find new ways to improve every aspect of what we do. Expect great training as you take on real projects with support from the team around you. You&rsquo;ll even get to meet our CEO, Lucy Hagues, who started on our Graduate Programme, and now heads up the UK business.</p><p></p><p>
And it isn&rsquo;t just about honing your professional skills. There's plenty of scope for personal development too. You'll be assigned a manager, mentor and buddy to support and advise you along the way. You can also get involved in social events run by our dedicated GradComms team or give back to the community through any of our corporate social responsibility initiatives.</p><p></p><p><b>
What will you need?</b></p><p>
To start with, you need to be in the penultimate year of your studies. The subject of your degree is not important, but you will need an aptitude for maths, along with an inquisitive mindset and a creative approach to problem-solving. You should also be keen to develop your skills in coding and analysis.</p><p></p><p>
Above all, we&rsquo;re looking for people who thrive in a collaborative environment, which means working well with others, while also being focused on growth and development &ndash; yours and ours.</p><p></p><p><b>
What&rsquo;s in it for you</b></p><ul><li><p>
The chance to contribute to the future roadmap of our organisation</p></li><li><p>
Exciting (and diverse) opportunities for career development</p></li><li><p>
Outstanding learning and development through our Capital One University training programmes (and appropriate external providers)</p></li><li><p>
 Core benefits including a pension scheme, bonus, generous holidays and private medical insurance</p></li><li><p>
Flexible benefits including season-ticket loans, cycle to work scheme and enhanced parental leave</p></li><li><p>
Open-plan workspaces and accessible facilities designed to support and inspire you, including a fully serviced gym, subsidised restaurant, mindfulness and games rooms</p></li></ul><p></p><p><b>
The Recruitment Process</b></p><p>
To ensure a flexible and accessible process, every stage will be conducted virtually. You'll also have a dedicated recruiter to support you throughout and answer any questions you might have.</p><p></p><p>
Step 1: After your initial application, if you meet the hiring criteria you will be sent out online testing to complete, which consists of a situational and strengths, and a numerical and verbal reasoning assessment.</p><p></p><p>
Step 2: Next up, you will be invited to complete a one way video interview.</p><p></p><p>
Step 3: You&rsquo;ll get to (virtually) meet with one of our Strategy Analysts to complete a case study interview.</p><p></p><p>
Step 4: The assessment day, which consists of a group activity, case study and individual interview, and if successful we&rsquo;ll offer you a place on the programme!</p><p></p><p><b>
What you should know about how we recruit</b></p><p>
We pride ourselves on hiring the best people, not the same people. Building diverse and inclusive teams is the right (and the smart) thing to do. We want to work with top talent: whoever you are, whatever you look like, wherever you come from. We know it&rsquo;s about what you do, not just what you say.

But the truth is, we're just as much a technology business. And we're here to make a positive difference &ndash; to our customers, our colleagues and society as a whole.</p><p></p><p>
One of the happy consequences of making finance easier for our customers is that it makes Capital One an inspiring place to launch your career. Join us, and you can gain valuable experience as you take on meaningful work in collaborative teams.</p><p></p><p>
We are committed to creating a level playing field and seek to create teams that are representative of our customers and the communities we serve. We&rsquo;d love to hear from you if you identify with an under-represented group in our industry and are particularly keen to hear from women, the LGBTQ+ community and ethnic minority candidates.</p><p></p><p>
We want to help you grow. That&rsquo;s why we invest heavily in your learning and development. We&rsquo;ve got a great track record of hiring graduates and enabling them to reach their full potential. Just look at our CEO, Lucy Hagues. She started as a graduate and now leads the UK business. And that&rsquo;s just one of many success stories.</p><p></p><p><b><br>
Strategy Analysts at Capital One</b></p><p>
You&rsquo;ll come at problems from fresh new angles. You&rsquo;ll bring great ideas (and you won't be afraid to share them). You&rsquo;ll keep our whole organisation on the right track. You'll use insightful data analysis along with critical judgement skills to solve problems and drive change that leads the whole industry forwards.</p><p></p><p>
At Capital One, we&rsquo;re always looking at ways to boost our business and give our customers a better experience. On this ten-week programme, you&rsquo;ll take a bird&rsquo;s eye view of our business, and help us find new ways to improve every aspect of what we do. Expect great training as you take on real projects with support from the team around you. You&rsquo;ll even get to meet our CEO, Lucy Hagues, who started on our Graduate Programme, and now heads up the UK business.</p><p></p><p>
And it isn&rsquo;t just about honing your professional skills. There's plenty of scope for personal development too. You'll be assigned a manager, mentor and buddy to support and advise you along the way. You can also get involved in social events run by our dedicated GradComms team or give back to the community through any of our corporate social responsibility initiatives.</p><p></p><p><b>
What will you need?</b></p><p>
To start with, you need to be in the penultimate year of your studies. The subject of your degree is not important, but you will need an aptitude for maths, along with an inquisitive mindset and a creative approach to problem-solving. You should also be keen to develop your skills in coding and analysis.</p><p></p><p>
Above all, we&rsquo;re looking for people who thrive in a collaborative environment, which means working well with others, while also being focused on growth and development &ndash; yours and ours.</p><p></p><p><b>
What&rsquo;s in it for you</b></p><ul><li><p>
The chance to contribute to the future roadmap of our organisation</p></li><li><p>

Step 4: The assessment day, which consists of a group activity, case study and individual interview, and if successful we&rsquo;ll offer you a place on the programme!</p><p></p><p><b>

Ten weeks to discover what our business is about.
</b></p><p><b>That's one good thing.</b></p><p>
At Capital One, we're on a mission: to change the world of credit for better &ndash; one small, good thing at a time. You might think of us as a credit card company. But the truth is, we're just as much a technology business. And we're here to make a positive difference &ndash; to our customers, our colleagues and society as a whole.</p><p></p><p>
One of the happy consequences of making finance easier for our customers is that it makes Capital One an inspiring place to launch your career. Join us, and you can gain valuable experience as you take on meaningful work in collaborative teams.</p><p></p><p>
We are committed to creating a level playing field and seek to create teams that are representative of our customers and the communities we serve. We&rsquo;d love to hear from you if you identify with an under-represented group in our industry and are particularly keen to hear from women, the LGBTQ+ community and ethnic minority candidates.</p><p></p><p>
We want to help you grow. That&rsquo;s why we invest heavily in your learning and development. We&rsquo;ve got a great track record of hiring graduates and enabling them to reach their full potential. Just look at our CEO, Lucy Hagues. She started as a graduate and now leads the UK business. And that&rsquo;s just one of many success stories.</p><p></p><p><b><br>
Strategy Analysts at Capital One</b></p><p>
You&rsquo;ll come at problems from fresh new angles. You&rsquo;ll bring great ideas (and you won't be afraid to share them). You&rsquo;ll keep our whole organisation on the right track. You'll use insightful data analysis along with critical judgement skills to solve problems and drive change that leads the whole industry forwards.</p><p></p><p>
At Capital One, we&rsquo;re always looking at ways to boost our business and give our customers a better experience. On this ten-week programme, you&rsquo;ll take a bird&rsquo;s eye view of our business, and help us find new ways to improve every aspect of what we do. Expect great training as you take on real projects with support from the team around you. You&rsquo;ll even get to meet our CEO, Lucy Hagues, who started on our Graduate Programme, and now heads up the UK business.</p><p></p><p>
And it isn&rsquo;t just about honing your professional skills. There's plenty of scope for personal development too. You'll be assigned a manager, mentor and buddy to support and advise you along the way. You can also get involved in social events run by our dedicated GradComms team or give back to the community through any of our corporate social responsibility initiatives.</p><p></p><p><b>
What will you need?</b></p><p>
To start with, you need to be in the penultimate year of your studies. The subject of your degree is not important, but you will need an aptitude for maths, along with an inquisitive mindset and a creative approach to problem-solving. You should also be keen to develop your skills in coding and analysis.</p><p></p><p>
Above all, we&rsquo;re looking for people who thrive in a collaborative environment, which means working well with others, while also being focused on growth and development &ndash; yours and ours.</p><p></p><p><b>
What&rsquo;s in it for you</b></p><ul><li><p>
The chance to contribute to the future roadmap of our organisation</p></li><li><p>
Exciting (and diverse) opportunities for career development</p></li><li><p>
Outstanding learning and development through our Capital One University training programmes (and appropriate external providers)</p></li><li><p>
 Core benefits including a pension scheme, bonus, generous holidays and private medical insurance</p></li><li><p>
Flexible benefits including season-ticket loans, cycle to work scheme and enhanced parental leave</p></li><li><p>
Open-plan workspaces and accessible facilities designed to support and inspire you, including a fully serviced gym, subsidised restaurant, mindfulness and games rooms</p></li></ul><p></p><p><b>
The Recruitment Process</b></p><p>
To ensure a flexible and accessible process, every stage will be conducted virtually. You'll also have a dedicated recruiter to support you throughout and answer any questions you might have.</p><p></p><p>
Step 1: After your initial application, if you meet the hiring criteria you will be sent out online testing to complete, which consists of a situational and strengths, and a numerical and verbal reasoning assessment.</p><p></p><p>
Step 2: Next up, you will be invited to complete a one way video interview.</p><p></p><p>
Step 3: You&rsquo;ll get to (virtually) meet with one of our Strategy Analysts to complete a case study interview.</p><p></p><p>
Step 4: The assessment day, which consists of a group activity, case study and individual interview, and if successful we&rsquo;ll offer you a place on the programme!</p><p></p><p><b>
What you should know about how we recruit</b></p><p>
We pride ourselves on hiring the best people, not the same people. Building diverse and inclusive teams is the right (and the smart) thing to do.

Ten weeks to discover what our business is about.
</b></p><p><b>That's one good thing.</b></p><p>
At Capital One, we're on a mission: to change the world of credit for better &ndash; one small, good thing at a time. You might think of us as a credit card company. But the truth is, we're just as much a technology business. And we're here to make a positive difference &ndash; to our customers, our colleagues and society as a whole.</p><p></p><p>
One of the happy consequences of making finance easier for our customers is that it makes Capital One an inspiring place to launch your career. Join us, and you can gain valuable experience as you take on meaningful work in collaborative teams.</p><p></p><p>
We are committed to creating a level playing field and seek to create teams that are representative of our customers and the communities we serve. We&rsquo;d love to hear from you if you identify with an under-represented group in our industry and are particularly keen to hear from women, the LGBTQ+ community and ethnic minority candidates.</p><p></p><p>
We want to help you grow. That&rsquo;s why we invest heavily in your learning and development. We&rsquo;ve got a great track record of hiring graduates and enabling them to reach their full potential. Just look at our CEO, Lucy Hagues. She started as a graduate and now leads the UK business. And that&rsquo;s just one of many success stories.</p><p></p><p><b><br>
Strategy Analysts at Capital One</b></p><p>
You&rsquo;ll come at problems from fresh new angles. You&rsquo;ll bring great ideas (and you won't be afraid to share them). You&rsquo;ll keep our whole organisation on the right track. You'll use insightful data analysis along with critical judgement skills to solve problems and drive change that leads the whole industry forwards.</p><p></p><p>
At Capital One, we&rsquo;re always looking at ways to boost our business and give our customers a better experience. On this ten-week programme, you&rsquo;ll take a bird&rsquo;s eye view of our business, and help us find new ways to improve every aspect of what we do. Expect great training as you take on real projects with support from the team around you. You&rsquo;ll even get to meet our CEO, Lucy Hagues, who started on our Graduate Programme, and now heads up the UK business.</p><p></p><p>
And it isn&rsquo;t just about honing your professional skills. There's plenty of scope for personal development too. You'll be assigned a manager, mentor and buddy to support and advise you along the way. You can also get involved in social events run by our dedicated GradComms team or give back to the community through any of our corporate social responsibility initiatives.</p><p></p><p><b>
What will you need?</b></p><p>
To start with, you need to be in the penultimate year of your studies. The subject of your degree is not important, but you will need an aptitude for maths, along with an inquisitive mindset and a creative approach to problem-solving. You should also be keen to develop your skills in coding and analysis.</p><p></p><p>
Above all, we&rsquo;re looking for people who thrive in a collaborative environment, which means working well with others, while also being focused on growth and development &ndash; yours and ours.</p><p></p><p><b>
What&rsquo;s in it for you</b></p><ul><li><p>
The chance to contribute to the future roadmap of our organisation</p></li><li><p>
Exciting (and diverse) opportunities for career development</p></li><li><p>
Outstanding learning and development through our Capital One University training programmes (and appropriate external providers)</p></li><li><p>
 Core benefits including a pension scheme, bonus, generous holidays and private medical insurance</p></li><li><p>
Flexible benefits including season-ticket loans, cycle to work scheme and enhanced parental leave</p></li><li><p>
Open-plan workspaces and accessible facilities designed to support and inspire you, including a fully serviced gym, subsidised restaurant, mindfulness and games rooms</p></li></ul><p></p><p><b>
The Recruitment Process</b></p><p>
To ensure a flexible and accessible process, every stage will be conducted virtually. You'll also have a dedicated recruiter to support you throughout and answer any questions you might have.</p><p></p><p>
Step 1: After your initial application, if you meet the hiring criteria you will be sent out online testing to complete, which consists of a situational and strengths, and a numerical and verbal reasoning assessment.</p><p></p><p>
Step 2: Next up, you will be invited to complete a one way video interview.</p><p></p><p>
Step 3: You&rsquo;ll get to (virtually) meet with one of our Strategy Analysts to complete a case study interview.</p><p></p><p>
Step 4: The assessment day, which consists of a group activity, case study and individual interview, and if successful we&rsquo;ll offer you a place on the programme!</p><p></p><p><b>
What you should know about how we recruit</b></p><p>
We pride ourselves on hiring the best people, not the same people. Building diverse and inclusive teams is the right (and the smart) thing to do.

Ten weeks to discover what our business is about.
</b></p><p><b>That's one good thing.</b></p><p>
At Capital One, we're on a mission: to change the world of credit for better &ndash; one small, good thing at a time. You might think of us as a credit card company. But the truth is, we're just as much a technology business. And we're here to make a positive difference &ndash; to our customers, our colleagues and society as a whole.</p><p></p><p>
One of the happy consequences of making finance easier for our customers is that it makes Capital One an inspiring place to launch your career. Join us, and you can gain valuable experience as you take on meaningful work in collaborative teams.</p><p></p><p>
We are committed to creating a level playing field and seek to create teams that are representative of our customers and the communities we serve. We&rsquo;d love to hear from you if you identify with an under-represented group in our industry and are particularly keen to hear from women, the LGBTQ+ community and ethnic minority candidates.</p><p></p><p>
We want to help you grow. That&rsquo;s why we invest heavily in your learning and development. We&rsquo;ve got a great track record of hiring graduates and enabling them to reach their full potential. Just look at our CEO, Lucy Hagues. She started as a graduate and now leads the UK business. And that&rsquo;s just one of many success stories.</p><p></p><p><b><br>
Strategy Analysts at Capital One</b></p><p>
You&rsquo;ll come at problems from fresh new angles. You&rsquo;ll bring great ideas (and you won't be afraid to share them). You&rsquo;ll keep our whole organisation on the right track. You'll use insightful data analysis along with critical judgement skills to solve problems and drive change that leads the whole industry forwards.</p><p></p><p>
At Capital One, we&rsquo;re always looking at ways to boost our business and give our customers a better experience. On this ten-week programme, you&rsquo;ll take a bird&rsquo;s eye view of our business, and help us find new ways to improve every aspect of what we do. Expect great training as you take on real projects with support from the team around you. You&rsquo;ll even get to meet our CEO, Lucy Hagues, who started on our Graduate Programme, and now heads up the UK business.</p><p></p><p>
And it isn&rsquo;t just about honing your professional skills. There's plenty of scope for personal development too. You'll be assigned a manager, mentor and buddy to support and advise you along the way. You can also get involved in social events run by our dedicated GradComms team or give back to the community through any of our corporate social responsibility initiatives.</p><p></p><p><b>
What will you need?</b></p><p>
To start with, you need to be in the penultimate year of your studies. The subject of your degree is not important, but you will need an aptitude for maths, along with an inquisitive mindset and a creative approach to problem-solving. You should also be keen to develop your skills in coding and analysis.</p><p></p><p>
Above all, we&rsquo;re looking for people who thrive in a collaborative environment, which means working well with others, while also being focused on growth and development &ndash; yours and ours.</p><p></p><p><b>
What&rsquo;s in it for you</b></p><ul><li><p>
The chance to contribute to the future roadmap of our organisation</p></li><li><p>
Exciting (and diverse) opportunities for career development</p></li><li><p>

The Recruitment Process</b></p><p>
To ensure a flexible and accessible process, every stage will be conducted virtually. You'll also have a dedicated recruiter to support you throughout and answer any questions you might have.</p><p></p><p>
Step 1: After your initial application, if you meet the hiring criteria you will be sent out online testing to complete, which consists of a situational and strengths, and a numerical and verbal reasoning assessment.</p><p></p><p>
Step 2: Next up, you will be invited to complete a one way video interview.</p><p></p><p>
Step 3: You&rsquo;ll get to (virtually) meet with one of our Strategy Analysts to complete a case study interview.</p><p></p><p>
Step 4: The assessment day, which consists of a group activity, case study and individual interview, and if successful we&rsquo;ll offer you a place on the programme!</p><p></p><p><b>
What you should know about how we recruit</b></p><p>
We pride ourselves on hiring the best people, not the same people. Building diverse and inclusive teams is the right (and the smart) thing to do. We want to work with top talent: whoever you are, whatever you look like, wherever you come from. We know it&rsquo;s about what you do, not just what you say.

Ten weeks to discover what our business is about.
</b></p><p><b>That's one good thing.</b></p><p>
At Capital One, we're on a mission: to change the world of credit for better &ndash; one small, good thing at a time. You might think of us as a credit card company. But the truth is, we're just as much a technology business. And we're here to make a positive difference &ndash; to our customers, our colleagues and society as a whole.</p><p></p><p>
One of the happy consequences of making finance easier for our customers is that it makes Capital One an inspiring place to launch your career. Join us, and you can gain valuable experience as you take on meaningful work in collaborative teams.</p><p></p><p>
We are committed to creating a level playing field and seek to create teams that are representative of our customers and the communities we serve. We&rsquo;d love to hear from you if you identify with an under-represented group in our industry and are particularly keen to hear from women, the LGBTQ+ community and ethnic minority candidates.</p><p></p><p>
We want to help you grow. That&rsquo;s why we invest heavily in your learning and development. We&rsquo;ve got a great track record of hiring graduates and enabling them to reach their full potential. Just look at our CEO, Lucy Hagues. She started as a graduate and now leads the UK business. And that&rsquo;s just one of many success stories.</p><p></p><p><b><br>
Strategy Analysts at Capital One</b></p><p>
You&rsquo;ll come at problems from fresh new angles. You&rsquo;ll bring great ideas (and you won't be afraid to share them). You&rsquo;ll keep our whole organisation on the right track. You'll use insightful data analysis along with critical judgement skills to solve problems and drive change that leads the whole industry forwards.</p><p></p><p>
At Capital One, we&rsquo;re always looking at ways to boost our business and give our customers a better experience. On this ten-week programme, you&rsquo;ll take a bird&rsquo;s eye view of our business, and help us find new ways to improve every aspect of what we do. Expect great training as you take on real projects with support from the team around you. You&rsquo;ll even get to meet our CEO, Lucy Hagues, who started on our Graduate Programme, and now heads up the UK business.</p><p></p><p>
And it isn&rsquo;t just about honing your professional skills. There's plenty of scope for personal development too. You'll be assigned a manager, mentor and buddy to support and advise you along the way. You can also get involved in social events run by our dedicated GradComms team or give back to the community through any of our corporate social responsibility initiatives.</p><p></p><p><b>
What will you need?</b></p><p>
To start with, you need to be in the penultimate year of your studies. The subject of your degree is not important, but you will need an aptitude for maths, along with an inquisitive mindset and a creative approach to problem-solving. You should also be keen to develop your skills in coding and analysis.</p><p></p><p>
Above all, we&rsquo;re looking for people who thrive in a collaborative environment, which means working well with others, while also being focused on growth and development &ndash; yours and ours.</p><p></p><p><b>
What&rsquo;s in it for you</b></p><ul><li><p>
The chance to contribute to the future roadmap of our organisation</p></li><li><p>

The Recruitment Process</b></p><p>
To ensure a flexible and accessible process, every stage will be conducted virtually. You'll also have a dedicated recruiter to support you throughout and answer any questions you might have.</p><p></p><p>
Step 1: After your initial application, if you meet the hiring criteria you will be sent out online testing to complete, which consists of a situational and strengths, and a numerical and verbal reasoning assessment.</p><p></p><p>
Step 2: Next up, you will be invited to complete a one way video interview.</p><p></p><p>
Step 3: You&rsquo;ll get to (virtually) meet with one of our Strategy Analysts to complete a case study interview.</p><p></p><p>
Step 4: The assessment day, which consists of a group activity, case study and individual interview, and if successful we&rsquo;ll offer you a place on the programme!</p><p></p><p><b>

Ten weeks to discover what our business is about.
</b></p><p><b>That's one good thing.</b></p><p>
At Capital One, we're on a mission: to change the world of credit for better &ndash; one small, good thing at a time. You might think of us as a credit card company. But the truth is, we're just as much a technology business. And we're here to make a positive difference &ndash; to our customers, our colleagues and society as a whole.</p><p></p><p>
One of the happy consequences of making finance easier for our customers is that it makes Capital One an inspiring place to launch your career. Join us, and you can gain valuable experience as you take on meaningful work in collaborative teams.</p><p></p><p>
We are committed to creating a level playing field and seek to create teams that are representative of our customers and the communities we serve. We&rsquo;d love to hear from you if you identify with an under-represented group in our industry and are particularly keen to hear from women, the LGBTQ+ community and ethnic minority candidates.</p><p></p><p>
We want to help you grow. That&rsquo;s why we invest heavily in your learning and development. We&rsquo;ve got a great track record of hiring graduates and enabling them to reach their full potential. Just look at our CEO, Lucy Hagues. She started as a graduate and now leads the UK business. And that&rsquo;s just one of many success stories.</p><p></p><p><b><br>
Strategy Analysts at Capital One</b></p><p>
You&rsquo;ll come at problems from fresh new angles. You&rsquo;ll bring great ideas (and you won't be afraid to share them). You&rsquo;ll keep our whole organisation on the right track. You'll use insightful data analysis along with critical judgement skills to solve problems and drive change that leads the whole industry forwards.</p><p></p><p>
At Capital One, we&rsquo;re always looking at ways to boost our business and give our customers a better experience. On this ten-week programme, you&rsquo;ll take a bird&rsquo;s eye view of our business, and help us find new ways to improve every aspect of what we do. Expect great training as you take on real projects with support from the team around you. You&rsquo;ll even get to meet our CEO, Lucy Hagues, who started on our Graduate Programme, and now heads up the UK business.</p><p></p><p>
And it isn&rsquo;t just about honing your professional skills. There's plenty of scope for personal development too. You'll be assigned a manager, mentor and buddy to support and advise you along the way. You can also get involved in social events run by our dedicated GradComms team or give back to the community through any of our corporate social responsibility initiatives.</p><p></p><p><b>
What will you need?</b></p><p>
To start with, you need to be in the penultimate year of your studies. The subject of your degree is not important, but you will need an aptitude for maths, along with an inquisitive mindset and a creative approach to problem-solving. You should also be keen to develop your skills in coding and analysis.</p><p></p><p>
Above all, we&rsquo;re looking for people who thrive in a collaborative environment, which means working well with others, while also being focused on growth and development &ndash; yours and ours.</p><p></p><p><b>
What&rsquo;s in it for you</b></p><ul><li><p>
The chance to contribute to the future roadmap of our organisation</p></li><li><p>

The Recruitment Process</b></p><p>
To ensure a flexible and accessible process, every stage will be conducted virtually. You'll also have a dedicated recruiter to support you throughout and answer any questions you might have.</p><p></p><p>
Step 1: After your initial application, if you meet the hiring criteria you will be sent out online testing to complete, which consists of a situational and strengths, and a numerical and verbal reasoning assessment.</p><p></p><p>
Step 2: Next up, you will be invited to complete a one way video interview.</p><p></p><p>
Step 3: You&rsquo;ll get to (virtually) meet with one of our Strategy Analysts to complete a case study interview.</p><p></p><p>
Step 4: The assessment day, which consists of a group activity, case study and individual interview, and if successful we&rsquo;ll offer you a place on the programme!</p><p></p><p><b>
What you should know about how we recruit</b></p><p>
We pride ourselves on hiring the best people, not the same people. Building diverse and inclusive teams is the right (and the smart) thing to do.

Ten weeks to discover what our business is about.
</b></p><p><b>That's one good thing.</b></p><p>
At Capital One, we're on a mission: to change the world of credit for better &ndash; one small, good thing at a time. You might think of us as a credit card company. But the truth is, we're just as much a technology business. And we're here to make a positive difference &ndash; to our customers, our colleagues and society as a whole.</p><p></p><p>
One of the happy consequences of making finance easier for our customers is that it makes Capital One an inspiring place to launch your career. Join us, and you can gain valuable experience as you take on meaningful work in collaborative teams.</p><p></p><p>
We are committed to creating a level playing field and seek to create teams that are representative of our customers and the communities we serve. We&rsquo;d love to hear from you if you identify with an under-represented group in our industry and are particularly keen to hear from women, the LGBTQ+ community and ethnic minority candidates.</p><p></p><p>
We want to help you grow. That&rsquo;s why we invest heavily in your learning and development. We&rsquo;ve got a great track record of hiring graduates and enabling them to reach their full potential. Just look at our CEO, Lucy Hagues. She started as a graduate and now leads the UK business. And that&rsquo;s just one of many success stories.</p><p></p><p><b><br>
Strategy Analysts at Capital One</b></p><p>
You&rsquo;ll come at problems from fresh new angles. You&rsquo;ll bring great ideas (and you won't be afraid to share them). You&rsquo;ll keep our whole organisation on the right track. You'll use insightful data analysis along with critical judgement skills to solve problems and drive change that leads the whole industry forwards.</p><p></p><p>
At Capital One, we&rsquo;re always looking at ways to boost our business and give our customers a better experience. On this ten-week programme, you&rsquo;ll take a bird&rsquo;s eye view of our business, and help us find new ways to improve every aspect of what we do. Expect great training as you take on real projects with support from the team around you. You&rsquo;ll even get to meet our CEO, Lucy Hagues, who started on our Graduate Programme, and now heads up the UK business.</p><p></p><p>
And it isn&rsquo;t just about honing your professional skills. There's plenty of scope for personal development too. You'll be assigned a manager, mentor and buddy to support and advise you along the way. You can also get involved in social events run by our dedicated GradComms team or give back to the community through any of our corporate social responsibility initiatives.</p><p></p><p><b>
What will you need?</b></p><p>
To start with, you need to be in the penultimate year of your studies. The subject of your degree is not important, but you will need an aptitude for maths, along with an inquisitive mindset and a creative approach to problem-solving. You should also be keen to develop your skills in coding and analysis.</p><p></p><p>
Above all, we&rsquo;re looking for people who thrive in a collaborative environment, which means working well with others, while also being focused on growth and development &ndash; yours and ours.</p><p></p><p><b>

Step 2: Next up, you will be invited to complete a one way video interview.</p><p></p><p>

Ten weeks to discover what our business is about.
</b></p><p><b>That's one good thing.</b></p><p>
At Capital One, we're on a mission: to change the world of credit for better &ndash; one small, good thing at a time. You might think of us as a credit card company. But the truth is, we're just as much a technology business. And we're here to make a positive difference &ndash; to our customers, our colleagues and society as a whole.</p><p></p><p>
One of the happy consequences of making finance easier for our customers is that it makes Capital One an inspiring place to launch your career. Join us, and you can gain valuable experience as you take on meaningful work in collaborative teams.</p><p></p><p>
We are committed to creating a level playing field and seek to create teams that are representative of our customers and the communities we serve. We&rsquo;d love to hear from you if you identify with an under-represented group in our industry and are particularly keen to hear from women, the LGBTQ+ community and ethnic minority candidates.</p><p></p><p>
We want to help you grow. That&rsquo;s why we invest heavily in your learning and development. We&rsquo;ve got a great track record of hiring graduates and enabling them to reach their full potential. Just look at our CEO, Lucy Hagues. She started as a graduate and now leads the UK business. And that&rsquo;s just one of many success stories.</p><p></p><p><b><br>
Strategy Analysts at Capital One</b></p><p>
You&rsquo;ll come at problems from fresh new angles. You&rsquo;ll bring great ideas (and you won't be afraid to share them). You&rsquo;ll keep our whole organisation on the right track. You'll use insightful data analysis along with critical judgement skills to solve problems and drive change that leads the whole industry forwards.</p><p></p><p>
At Capital One, we&rsquo;re always looking at ways to boost our business and give our customers a better experience. On this ten-week programme, you&rsquo;ll take a bird&rsquo;s eye view of our business, and help us find new ways to improve every aspect of what we do. Expect great training as you take on real projects with support from the team around you. You&rsquo;ll even get to meet our CEO, Lucy Hagues, who started on our Graduate Programme, and now heads up the UK business.</p><p></p><p>
And it isn&rsquo;t just about honing your professional skills. There's plenty of scope for personal development too. You'll be assigned a manager, mentor and buddy to support and advise you along the way. You can also get involved in social events run by our dedicated GradComms team or give back to the community through any of our corporate social responsibility initiatives.</p><p></p><p><b>
What will you need?</b></p><p>
To start with, you need to be in the penultimate year of your studies. The subject of your degree is not important, but you will need an aptitude for maths, along with an inquisitive mindset and a creative approach to problem-solving. You should also be keen to develop your skills in coding and analysis.</p><p></p><p>
Above all, we&rsquo;re looking for people who thrive in a collaborative environment, which means working well with others, while also being focused on growth and development &ndash; yours and ours.</p><p></p><p><b>
What&rsquo;s in it for you</b></p><ul><li><p>
The chance to contribute to the future roadmap of our organisation</p></li><li><p>
Exciting (and diverse) opportunities for career development</p></li><li><p>
Outstanding learning and development through our Capital One University training programmes (and appropriate external providers)</p></li><li><p>
 Core benefits including a pension scheme, bonus, generous holidays and private medical insurance</p></li><li><p>

Open-plan workspaces and accessible facilities designed to support and inspire you, including a fully serviced gym, subsidised restaurant, mindfulness and games rooms</p></li></ul><p></p><p><b>
The Recruitment Process</b></p><p>
To ensure a flexible and accessible process, every stage will be conducted virtually. You'll also have a dedicated recruiter to support you throughout and answer any questions you might have.</p><p></p><p>
Step 1: After your initial application, if you meet the hiring criteria you will be sent out online testing to complete, which consists of a situational and strengths, and a numerical and verbal reasoning assessment.</p><p></p><p>
Step 2: Next up, you will be invited to complete a one way video interview.</p><p></p><p>
Step 3: You&rsquo;ll get to (virtually) meet with one of our Strategy Analysts to complete a case study interview.</p><p></p><p>
Step 4: The assessment day, which consists of a group activity, case study and individual interview, and if successful we&rsquo;ll offer you a place on the programme!</p><p></p><p><b>
What you should know about how we recruit</b></p><p>
We pride ourselves on hiring the best people, not the same people. Building diverse and inclusive teams is the right (and the smart) thing to do. We want to work with top talent: whoever you are, whatever you look like, wherever you come from. We know it&rsquo;s about what you do, not just what you say.

Ten weeks to discover what our business is about.
</b></p><p><b>That's one good thing.</b></p><p>
At Capital One, we're on a mission: to change the world of credit for better &ndash; one small, good thing at a time. You might think of us as a credit card company. But the truth is, we're just as much a technology business. And we're here to make a positive difference &ndash; to our customers, our colleagues and society as a whole.</p><p></p><p>
One of the happy consequences of making finance easier for our customers is that it makes Capital One an inspiring place to launch your career. Join us, and you can gain valuable experience as you take on meaningful work in collaborative teams.</p><p></p><p>
We are committed to creating a level playing field and seek to create teams that are representative of our customers and the communities we serve. We&rsquo;d love to hear from you if you identify with an under-represented group in our industry and are particularly keen to hear from women, the LGBTQ+ community and ethnic minority candidates.</p><p></p><p>
We want to help you grow. That&rsquo;s why we invest heavily in your learning and development. We&rsquo;ve got a great track record of hiring graduates and enabling them to reach their full potential. Just look at our CEO, Lucy Hagues. She started as a graduate and now leads the UK business. And that&rsquo;s just one of many success stories.</p><p></p><p><b><br>
Strategy Analysts at Capital One</b></p><p>
You&rsquo;ll come at problems from fresh new angles. You&rsquo;ll bring great ideas (and you won't be afraid to share them). You&rsquo;ll keep our whole organisation on the right track. You'll use insightful data analysis along with critical judgement skills to solve problems and drive change that leads the whole industry forwards.</p><p></p><p>
At Capital One, we&rsquo;re always looking at ways to boost our business and give our customers a better experience. On this ten-week programme, you&rsquo;ll take a bird&rsquo;s eye view of our business, and help us find new ways to improve every aspect of what we do. Expect great training as you take on real projects with support from the team around you. You&rsquo;ll even get to meet our CEO, Lucy Hagues, who started on our Graduate Programme, and now heads up the UK business.</p><p></p><p>
And it isn&rsquo;t just about honing your professional skills. There's plenty of scope for personal development too. You'll be assigned a manager, mentor and buddy to support and advise you along the way. You can also get involved in social events run by our dedicated GradComms team or give back to the community through any of our corporate social responsibility initiatives.</p><p></p><p><b>
What will you need?</b></p><p>
To start with, you need to be in the penultimate year of your studies. The subject of your degree is not important, but you will need an aptitude for maths, along with an inquisitive mindset and a creative approach to problem-solving. You should also be keen to develop your skills in coding and analysis.</p><p></p><p>
Above all, we&rsquo;re looking for people who thrive in a collaborative environment, which means working well with others, while also being focused on growth and development &ndash; yours and ours.</p><p></p><p><b>
What&rsquo;s in it for you</b></p><ul><li><p>
The chance to contribute to the future roadmap of our organisation</p></li><li><p>
Exciting (and diverse) opportunities for career development</p></li><li><p>
Outstanding learning and development through our Capital One University training programmes (and appropriate external providers)</p></li><li><p>
 Core benefits including a pension scheme, bonus, generous holidays and private medical insurance</p></li><li><p>
Flexible benefits including season-ticket loans, cycle to work scheme and enhanced parental leave</p></li><li><p>
Open-plan workspaces and accessible facilities designed to support and inspire you, including a fully serviced gym, subsidised restaurant, mindfulness and games rooms</p></li></ul><p></p><p><b>
The Recruitment Process</b></p><p>
To ensure a flexible and accessible process, every stage will be conducted virtually. You'll also have a dedicated recruiter to support you throughout and answer any questions you might have.</p><p></p><p>
Step 1: After your initial application, if you meet the hiring criteria you will be sent out online testing to complete, which consists of a situational and strengths, and a numerical and verbal reasoning assessment.</p><p></p><p>
Step 2: Next up, you will be invited to complete a one way video interview.</p><p></p><p>
Step 3: You&rsquo;ll get to (virtually) meet with one of our Strategy Analysts to complete a case study interview.</p><p></p><p>
Step 4: The assessment day, which consists of a group activity, case study and individual interview, and if successful we&rsquo;ll offer you a place on the programme!</p><p></p><p><b>
What you should know about how we recruit</b></p><p>
We pride ourselves on hiring the best people, not the same people. Building diverse and inclusive teams is the right (and the smart) thing to do. We want to work with top talent: whoever you are, whatever you look like, wherever you come from. We know it&rsquo;s about what you do, not just what you say.

Ten weeks to discover what our business is about.
</b></p><p><b>That's one good thing.</b></p><p>
At Capital One, we're on a mission: to change the world of credit for better &ndash; one small, good thing at a time. You might think of us as a credit card company. But the truth is, we're just as much a technology business. And we're here to make a positive difference &ndash; to our customers, our colleagues and society as a whole.</p><p></p><p>
One of the happy consequences of making finance easier for our customers is that it makes Capital One an inspiring place to launch your career. Join us, and you can gain valuable experience as you take on meaningful work in collaborative teams.</p><p></p><p>
We are committed to creating a level playing field and seek to create teams that are representative of our customers and the communities we serve. We&rsquo;d love to hear from you if you identify with an under-represented group in our industry and are particularly keen to hear from women, the LGBTQ+ community and ethnic minority candidates.</p><p></p><p>
We want to help you grow. That&rsquo;s why we invest heavily in your learning and development. We&rsquo;ve got a great track record of hiring graduates and enabling them to reach their full potential. Just look at our CEO, Lucy Hagues. She started as a graduate and now leads the UK business. And that&rsquo;s just one of many success stories.</p><p></p><p><b><br>

You&rsquo;ll come at problems from fresh new angles. You&rsquo;ll bring great ideas (and you won't be afraid to share them). You&rsquo;ll keep our whole organisation on the right track. You'll use insightful data analysis along with critical judgement skills to solve problems and drive change that leads the whole industry forwards.</p><p></p><p>
At Capital One, we&rsquo;re always looking at ways to boost our business and give our customers a better experience. On this ten-week programme, you&rsquo;ll take a bird&rsquo;s eye view of our business, and help us find new ways to improve every aspect of what we do. Expect great training as you take on real projects with support from the team around you. You&rsquo;ll even get to meet our CEO, Lucy Hagues, who started on our Graduate Programme, and now heads up the UK business.</p><p></p><p>
And it isn&rsquo;t just about honing your professional skills. There's plenty of scope for personal development too. You'll be assigned a manager, mentor and buddy to support and advise you along the way. You can also get involved in social events run by our dedicated GradComms team or give back to the community through any of our corporate social responsibility initiatives.</p><p></p><p><b>
What will you need?</b></p><p>
To start with, you need to be in the penultimate year of your studies. The subject of your degree is not important, but you will need an aptitude for maths, along with an inquisitive mindset and a creative approach to problem-solving. You should also be keen to develop your skills in coding and analysis.</p><p></p><p>
Above all, we&rsquo;re looking for people who thrive in a collaborative environment, which means working well with others, while also being focused on growth and development &ndash; yours and ours.</p><p></p><p><b>

Step 2: Next up, you will be invited to complete a one way video interview.</p><p></p><p>

Ten weeks to discover what our business is about.
</b></p><p><b>That's one good thing.</b></p><p>
At Capital One, we're on a mission: to change the world of credit for better &ndash; one small, good thing at a time. You might think of us as a credit card company. But the truth is, we're just as much a technology business. And we're here to make a positive difference &ndash; to our customers, our colleagues and society as a whole.</p><p></p><p>
One of the happy consequences of making finance easier for our customers is that it makes Capital One an inspiring place to launch your career. Join us, and you can gain valuable experience as you take on meaningful work in collaborative teams.</p><p></p><p>
We are committed to creating a level playing field and seek to create teams that are representative of our customers and the communities we serve. We&rsquo;d love to hear from you if you identify with an under-represented group in our industry and are particularly keen to hear from women, the LGBTQ+ community and ethnic minority candidates.</p><p></p><p>
We want to help you grow. That&rsquo;s why we invest heavily in your learning and development. We&rsquo;ve got a great track record of hiring graduates and enabling them to reach their full potential. Just look at our CEO, Lucy Hagues. She started as a graduate and now leads the UK business. And that&rsquo;s just one of many success stories.</p><p></p><p><b><br>
Strategy Analysts at Capital One</b></p><p>
You&rsquo;ll come at problems from fresh new angles. You&rsquo;ll bring great ideas (and you won't be afraid to share them). You&rsquo;ll keep our whole organisation on the right track. You'll use insightful data analysis along with critical judgement skills to solve problems and drive change that leads the whole industry forwards.</p><p></p><p>
At Capital One, we&rsquo;re always looking at ways to boost our business and give our customers a better experience. On this ten-week programme, you&rsquo;ll take a bird&rsquo;s eye view of our business, and help us find new ways to improve every aspect of what we do. Expect great training as you take on real projects with support from the team around you. You&rsquo;ll even get to meet our CEO, Lucy Hagues, who started on our Graduate Programme, and now heads up the UK business.</p><p></p><p>
And it isn&rsquo;t just about honing your professional skills. There's plenty of scope for personal development too. You'll be assigned a manager, mentor and buddy to support and advise you along the way. You can also get involved in social events run by our dedicated GradComms team or give back to the community through any of our corporate social responsibility initiatives.</p><p></p><p><b>
What will you need?</b></p><p>
To start with, you need to be in the penultimate year of your studies. The subject of your degree is not important, but you will need an aptitude for maths, along with an inquisitive mindset and a creative approach to problem-solving. You should also be keen to develop your skills in coding and analysis.</p><p></p><p>
Above all, we&rsquo;re looking for people who thrive in a collaborative environment, which means working well with others, while also being focused on growth and development &ndash; yours and ours.</p><p></p><p><b>
What&rsquo;s in it for you</b></p><ul><li><p>
The chance to contribute to the future roadmap of our organisation</p></li><li><p>
Exciting (and diverse) opportunities for career development</p></li><li><p>
Outstanding learning and development through our Capital One University training programmes (and appropriate external providers)</p></li><li><p>
 Core benefits including a pension scheme, bonus, generous holidays and private medical insurance</p></li><li><p>
Flexible benefits including season-ticket loans, cycle to work scheme and enhanced parental leave</p></li><li><p>
Open-plan workspaces and accessible facilities designed to support and inspire you, including a fully serviced gym, subsidised restaurant, mindfulness and games rooms</p></li></ul><p></p><p><b>
The Recruitment Process</b></p><p>
To ensure a flexible and accessible process, every stage will be conducted virtually. You'll also have a dedicated recruiter to support you throughout and answer any questions you might have.</p><p></p><p>
Step 1: After your initial application, if you meet the hiring criteria you will be sent out online testing to complete, which consists of a situational and strengths, and a numerical and verbal reasoning assessment.</p><p></p><p>
Step 2: Next up, you will be invited to complete a one way video interview.</p><p></p><p>
Step 3: You&rsquo;ll get to (virtually) meet with one of our Strategy Analysts to complete a case study interview.</p><p></p><p>
Step 4: The assessment day, which consists of a group activity, case study and individual interview, and if successful we&rsquo;ll offer you a place on the programme!</p><p></p><p><b>
What you should know about how we recruit</b></p><p>
We pride ourselves on hiring the best people, not the same people. Building diverse and inclusive teams is the right (and the smart) thing to do. We want to work with top talent: whoever you are, whatever you look like, wherever you come from. We know it&rsquo;s about what you do, not just what you say. That&rsquo;s why we make our recruitment process fair and accessible.</p><p></p><p>
We also partner with organisations including the Women in Finance and Race At Work Charters, Stonewall and upReach to find people from every walk of life and help them thrive with us.

Ten weeks to discover what our business is about.
</b></p><p><b>That's one good thing.</b></p><p>
At Capital One, we're on a mission: to change the world of credit for better &ndash; one small, good thing at a time. You might think of us as a credit card company. But the truth is, we're just as much a technology business. And we're here to make a positive difference &ndash; to our customers, our colleagues and society as a whole.</p><p></p><p>
One of the happy consequences of making finance easier for our customers is that it makes Capital One an inspiring place to launch your career. Join us, and you can gain valuable experience as you take on meaningful work in collaborative teams.</p><p></p><p>
We are committed to creating a level playing field and seek to create teams that are representative of our customers and the communities we serve. We&rsquo;d love to hear from you if you identify with an under-represented group in our industry and are particularly keen to hear from women, the LGBTQ+ community and ethnic minority candidates.</p><p></p><p>
We want to help you grow. That&rsquo;s why we invest heavily in your learning and development. We&rsquo;ve got a great track record of hiring graduates and enabling them to reach their full potential. Just look at our CEO, Lucy Hagues. She started as a graduate and now leads the UK business. And that&rsquo;s just one of many success stories.</p><p></p><p><b><br>
Strategy Analysts at Capital One</b></p><p>
You&rsquo;ll come at problems from fresh new angles. You&rsquo;ll bring great ideas (and you won't be afraid to share them). You&rsquo;ll keep our whole organisation on the right track. You'll use insightful data analysis along with critical judgement skills to solve problems and drive change that leads the whole industry forwards.</p><p></p><p>
At Capital One, we&rsquo;re always looking at ways to boost our business and give our customers a better experience. On this ten-week programme, you&rsquo;ll take a bird&rsquo;s eye view of our business, and help us find new ways to improve every aspect of what we do. Expect great training as you take on real projects with support from the team around you. You&rsquo;ll even get to meet our CEO, Lucy Hagues, who started on our Graduate Programme, and now heads up the UK business.</p><p></p><p>
And it isn&rsquo;t just about honing your professional skills. There's plenty of scope for personal development too. You'll be assigned a manager, mentor and buddy to support and advise you along the way. You can also get involved in social events run by our dedicated GradComms team or give back to the community through any of our corporate social responsibility initiatives.</p><p></p><p><b>
What will you need?</b></p><p>
To start with, you need to be in the penultimate year of your studies. The subject of your degree is not important, but you will need an aptitude for maths, along with an inquisitive mindset and a creative approach to problem-solving. You should also be keen to develop your skills in coding and analysis.</p><p></p><p>
Above all, we&rsquo;re looking for people who thrive in a collaborative environment, which means working well with others, while also being focused on growth and development &ndash; yours and ours.</p><p></p><p><b>

The Recruitment Process</b></p><p>
To ensure a flexible and accessible process, every stage will be conducted virtually. You'll also have a dedicated recruiter to support you throughout and answer any questions you might have.</p><p></p><p>
Step 1: After your initial application, if you meet the hiring criteria you will be sent out online testing to complete, which consists of a situational and strengths, and a numerical and verbal reasoning assessment.</p><p></p><p>
Step 2: Next up, you will be invited to complete a one way video interview.</p><p></p><p>
Step 3: You&rsquo;ll get to (virtually) meet with one of our Strategy Analysts to complete a case study interview.</p><p></p><p>
Step 4: The assessment day, which consists of a group activity, case study and individual interview, and if successful we&rsquo;ll offer you a place on the programme!</p><p></p><p><b>
What you should know about how we recruit</b></p><p>
We pride ourselves on hiring the best people, not the same people. Building diverse and inclusive teams is the right (and the smart) thing to do.

Ten weeks to discover what our business is about.
</b></p><p><b>That's one good thing.</b></p><p>
At Capital One, we're on a mission: to change the world of credit for better &ndash; one small, good thing at a time. You might think of us as a credit card company. But the truth is, we're just as much a technology business. And we're here to make a positive difference &ndash; to our customers, our colleagues and society as a whole.</p><p></p><p>
One of the happy consequences of making finance easier for our customers is that it makes Capital One an inspiring place to launch your career. Join us, and you can gain valuable experience as you take on meaningful work in collaborative teams.</p><p></p><p>
We are committed to creating a level playing field and seek to create teams that are representative of our customers and the communities we serve. We&rsquo;d love to hear from you if you identify with an under-represented group in our industry and are particularly keen to hear from women, the LGBTQ+ community and ethnic minority candidates.</p><p></p><p>
We want to help you grow. That&rsquo;s why we invest heavily in your learning and development. We&rsquo;ve got a great track record of hiring graduates and enabling them to reach their full potential. Just look at our CEO, Lucy Hagues. She started as a graduate and now leads the UK business. And that&rsquo;s just one of many success stories.</p><p></p><p><b><br>
Strategy Analysts at Capital One</b></p><p>
You&rsquo;ll come at problems from fresh new angles. You&rsquo;ll bring great ideas (and you won't be afraid to share them). You&rsquo;ll keep our whole organisation on the right track. You'll use insightful data analysis along with critical judgement skills to solve problems and drive change that leads the whole industry forwards.</p><p></p><p>
At Capital One, we&rsquo;re always looking at ways to boost our business and give our customers a better experience. On this ten-week programme, you&rsquo;ll take a bird&rsquo;s eye view of our business, and help us find new ways to improve every aspect of what we do. Expect great training as you take on real projects with support from the team around you. You&rsquo;ll even get to meet our CEO, Lucy Hagues, who started on our Graduate Programme, and now heads up the UK business.</p><p></p><p>
And it isn&rsquo;t just about honing your professional skills. There's plenty of scope for personal development too. You'll be assigned a manager, mentor and buddy to support and advise you along the way. You can also get involved in social events run by our dedicated GradComms team or give back to the community through any of our corporate social responsibility initiatives.</p><p></p><p><b>
What will you need?</b></p><p>
To start with, you need to be in the penultimate year of your studies. The subject of your degree is not important, but you will need an aptitude for maths, along with an inquisitive mindset and a creative approach to problem-solving. You should also be keen to develop your skills in coding and analysis.</p><p></p><p>
Above all, we&rsquo;re looking for people who thrive in a collaborative environment, which means working well with others, while also being focused on growth and development &ndash; yours and ours.</p><p></p><p><b>
What&rsquo;s in it for you</b></p><ul><li><p>
The chance to contribute to the future roadmap of our organisation</p></li><li><p>
Exciting (and diverse) opportunities for career development</p></li><li><p>
Outstanding learning and development through our Capital One University training programmes (and appropriate external providers)</p></li><li><p>
 Core benefits including a pension scheme, bonus, generous holidays and private medical insurance</p></li><li><p>

The Recruitment Process</b></p><p>
To ensure a flexible and accessible process, every stage will be conducted virtually. You'll also have a dedicated recruiter to support you throughout and answer any questions you might have.</p><p></p><p>
Step 1: After your initial application, if you meet the hiring criteria you will be sent out online testing to complete, which consists of a situational and strengths, and a numerical and verbal reasoning assessment.</p><p></p><p>
Step 2: Next up, you will be invited to complete a one way video interview.</p><p></p><p>
Step 3: You&rsquo;ll get to (virtually) meet with one of our Strategy Analysts to complete a case study interview.</p><p></p><p>
Step 4: The assessment day, which consists of a group activity, case study and individual interview, and if successful we&rsquo;ll offer you a place on the programme!</p><p></p><p><b>
What you should know about how we recruit</b></p><p>
We pride ourselves on hiring the best people, not the same people. Building diverse and inclusive teams is the right (and the smart) thing to do.
