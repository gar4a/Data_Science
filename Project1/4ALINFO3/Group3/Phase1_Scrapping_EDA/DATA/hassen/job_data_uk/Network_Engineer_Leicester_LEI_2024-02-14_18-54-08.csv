National Gas fuels innovation, growth and your ambition. Sound like the workplace for you? Read on.<br>
<br>
As the E&amp;I Operations Engineer for an area of the West Midlands in Gas Transmission, you'll lead the plan to execute maintenance activities, support large capital projects and deliver smaller projects to resolve defects and operational risks within your engineering discipline, working 'hands-on' alongside the Area Manager, Mechanical Operations Engineer and Technicians in the area.<br>
<br>
You&rsquo;ll be surrounded by talented people with all sorts of skill sets and specialities. They&rsquo;ll still turn to you for technical expertise, because when it comes to knowledge of Electrical, Controls and Instrumentation, there&rsquo;s nobody better. Together you will maintain safe and reliable assets including gas turbine and electric driven compressors, telemetry, valves and industrial control systems.<br>
<br>
You will be the technical lead for a specific engineering discipline within an operational area and to undertake the role of authorising engineer for all disciplines within the permit to work system. The operations engineer is a point of technical escalation accountable for the performance of assets and the safe control of operations on site.<br>
<br>
You will complete competency assessments of technicians to support the authorisation process and undertake workplace assessments of operational staff to ensure the ongoing competency of the team. Using key asset performance information you will prioritise maintenance interventions within an engineering discipline whilst leading the works to resolve defects within your area prioritising defects with the highest operational risk.<br>
<br>
You will provide technical input into design studies within an engineering discipline including safe working design, maintainability and whole life cost. You will also undertake the role of incident controller during planned and emergency situations and participate in a 24/7 standby rota and emergency response as a duty engineer.<br>
<br>
The successful candidate will have a strong engineering knowledge in the Electrical, Control and Instrumentation discipline with a sound understanding of engineering policy, procedures and statutory regulations associated with transmission assets.<br>
<br>
You will be a passionate believer in personal and process safety and have an awareness of project and financial management. You will have experience of faulty finding on industrial processes and be able to establish sustainable relationships with key internal and external personnel.<br>
<br>
While you will predominantly be based at single site, regular travel around the area will be required so you will need to hold a UK full valid car driving licence.<br>
<br>
At National Gas we really take the time to understand what you want to achieve out of your role and career, that&rsquo;s why we encourage people to speak about their personalised development plan early on. This might be developing in your existing role, you might even have your sights set on a higher level position, whatever it is we will give you the support and tools needed to succeed.<br>
