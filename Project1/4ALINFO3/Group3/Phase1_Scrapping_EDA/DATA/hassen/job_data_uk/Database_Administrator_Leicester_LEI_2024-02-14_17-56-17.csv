<div></div><div><div><p><b>Working Arrangements &amp; Further Information</b></p><p>
The MoJ offers Hybrid Working arrangements where business need allows. This is an informal, non-contractual form of flexible working that blends working from your base location, different MoJ sites and / or from home (please be aware that this role can only be worked in the UK and not overseas). Some roles will not be suitable for Hybrid Working. Similarly, Hybrid Working will not suit everyone&rsquo;s circumstances. Arrangements will be discussed and agreed with the successful candidate(s) and subject to regular review.</p><p>
For nationally advertised roles, the successful candidate(s) will be appointed to a MoJ office location, which may include their nearest Justice Collaboration Centre or Justice Satellite Office. This will be discussed and agreed on the completion of pre-employment checks.</p><p>
Some of MoJ&rsquo;s terms and conditions of service are changing as part of Civil Service reform. The changes will apply to staff joining MoJ who are new to the Civil Service. Staff joining MoJ from other civil service employers will transfer onto the new MoJ terms if they are already on 'modernised' terms in their current post or onto 'unmodernised' MoJ terms if they are on 'unmodernised' terms at their current post. Details will be available if an offer is made.</p><p>

If you were appointed internally and your leave was previously calculated in days, this will continue to be the case.</li></ul><p><b>
Bank, Public and Privilege Holidays</b></p><ul><li>You are entitled to 9 days (66 hours 36 minutes) in recognition of bank, public and privilege holidays.

ABOUT US</b></p>
<p>
Fostering People is a highly accredited community based fostering agency with over 20 years' experience of changing lives.</p>
<p>
Fostering People first opened its doors in 2000, when a local social worker came up with the idea of starting a new, independent fostering service in the East Midlands.</p>
<p>
Her idea was to provide plenty of excellent personal support, right in the heart of the local community. Today, this still holds true &ndash; except we&rsquo;re now present in even more communities: Scotland, the North East, North West, West Midlands, East of England and Yorkshire. In these places, the excellence of our work means we&rsquo;re the preferred choice of partner for many local authorities, who trust us to provide a high quality and caring local service. Just as importantly, so do foster parents in these communities.</p>

ABOUT US</b></p>
<p>
Fostering People is a highly accredited community based fostering agency with over 20 years' experience of changing lives.</p>
<p>
Fostering People first opened its doors in 2000, when a local social worker came up with the idea of starting a new, independent fostering service in the East Midlands.</p>
<p>
Her idea was to provide plenty of excellent personal support, right in the heart of the local community. Today, this still holds true &ndash; except we&rsquo;re now present in even more communities: Scotland, the North East, North West, West Midlands, East of England and Yorkshire. In these places, the excellence of our work means we&rsquo;re the preferred choice of partner for many local authorities, who trust us to provide a high quality and caring local service. Just as importantly, so do foster parents in these communities.</p>

ABOUT US</b></p>
<p>
Fostering People is a highly accredited community based fostering agency with over 20 years' experience of changing lives.</p>
<p>
Fostering People first opened its doors in 2000, when a local social worker came up with the idea of starting a new, independent fostering service in the East Midlands.</p>
<p>
Her idea was to provide plenty of excellent personal support, right in the heart of the local community. Today, this still holds true &ndash; except we&rsquo;re now present in even more communities: Scotland, the North East, North West, West Midlands, East of England and Yorkshire. In these places, the excellence of our work means we&rsquo;re the preferred choice of partner for many local authorities, who trust us to provide a high quality and caring local service. Just as importantly, so do foster parents in these communities.</p>

Fostering People first opened its doors in 2000, when a local social worker came up with the idea of starting a new, independent fostering service in the East Midlands.</p>
<p>
Her idea was to provide plenty of excellent personal support, right in the heart of the local community. Today, this still holds true &ndash; except we&rsquo;re now present in even more communities: Scotland, the North East, North West, West Midlands, East of England and Yorkshire. In these places, the excellence of our work means we&rsquo;re the preferred choice of partner for many local authorities, who trust us to provide a high quality and caring local service. Just as importantly, so do foster parents in these communities.</p>

ABOUT US</b></p>
<p>
Fostering People is a highly accredited community based fostering agency with over 20 years' experience of changing lives.</p>
<p>
Fostering People first opened its doors in 2000, when a local social worker came up with the idea of starting a new, independent fostering service in the East Midlands.</p>
<p>

Her idea was to provide plenty of excellent personal support, right in the heart of the local community. Today, this still holds true &ndash; except we&rsquo;re now present in even more communities: Scotland, the North East, North West, West Midlands, East of England and Yorkshire. In these places, the excellence of our work means we&rsquo;re the preferred choice of partner for many local authorities, who trust us to provide a high quality and caring local service. Just as importantly, so do foster parents in these communities.</p>

Her idea was to provide plenty of excellent personal support, right in the heart of the local community. Today, this still holds true &ndash; except we&rsquo;re now present in even more communities: Scotland, the North East, North West, West Midlands, East of England and Yorkshire. In these places, the excellence of our work means we&rsquo;re the preferred choice of partner for many local authorities, who trust us to provide a high quality and caring local service. Just as importantly, so do foster parents in these communities.</p>
<p><b>

ABOUT US</b></p>
<p>
Fostering People is a highly accredited community based fostering agency with over 20 years' experience of changing lives.</p>
<p>
Fostering People first opened its doors in 2000, when a local social worker came up with the idea of starting a new, independent fostering service in the East Midlands.</p>
<p>
Her idea was to provide plenty of excellent personal support, right in the heart of the local community.

Fostering People is a highly accredited community based fostering agency with over 20 years' experience of changing lives.</p>
<p>
Fostering People first opened its doors in 2000, when a local social worker came up with the idea of starting a new, independent fostering service in the East Midlands.</p>

Her idea was to provide plenty of excellent personal support, right in the heart of the local community. Today, this still holds true &ndash; except we&rsquo;re now present in even more communities: Scotland, the North East, North West, West Midlands, East of England and Yorkshire. In these places, the excellence of our work means we&rsquo;re the preferred choice of partner for many local authorities, who trust us to provide a high quality and caring local service. Just as importantly, so do foster parents in these communities.</p>

Fostering People is a highly accredited community based fostering agency with over 20 years' experience of changing lives.</p>
<p>
Fostering People first opened its doors in 2000, when a local social worker came up with the idea of starting a new, independent fostering service in the East Midlands.</p>

Her idea was to provide plenty of excellent personal support, right in the heart of the local community. Today, this still holds true &ndash; except we&rsquo;re now present in even more communities: Scotland, the North East, North West, West Midlands, East of England and Yorkshire. In these places, the excellence of our work means we&rsquo;re the preferred choice of partner for many local authorities, who trust us to provide a high quality and caring local service. Just as importantly, so do foster parents in these communities.</p>

Today, this still holds true &ndash; except we&rsquo;re now present in even more communities: Scotland, the North East, North West, West Midlands, East of England and Yorkshire. In these places, the excellence of our work means we&rsquo;re the preferred choice of partner for many local authorities, who trust us to provide a high quality and caring local service.

ABOUT US</b></p>
<p>
Fostering People is a highly accredited community based fostering agency with over 20 years' experience of changing lives.</p>
<p>
Fostering People first opened its doors in 2000, when a local social worker came up with the idea of starting a new, independent fostering service in the East Midlands.</p>
<p>
Her idea was to provide plenty of excellent personal support, right in the heart of the local community. Today, this still holds true &ndash; except we&rsquo;re now present in even more communities: Scotland, the North East, North West, West Midlands, East of England and Yorkshire. In these places, the excellence of our work means we&rsquo;re the preferred choice of partner for many local authorities, who trust us to provide a high quality and caring local service. Just as importantly, so do foster parents in these communities.</p>

Today, this still holds true &ndash; except we&rsquo;re now present in even more communities: Scotland, the North East, North West, West Midlands, East of England and Yorkshire. In these places, the excellence of our work means we&rsquo;re the preferred choice of partner for many local authorities, who trust us to provide a high quality and caring local service.

ABOUT US</b></p>
<p>
Fostering People is a highly accredited community based fostering agency with over 20 years' experience of changing lives.</p>
<p>
Fostering People first opened its doors in 2000, when a local social worker came up with the idea of starting a new, independent fostering service in the East Midlands.</p>
<p>
Her idea was to provide plenty of excellent personal support, right in the heart of the local community. Today, this still holds true &ndash; except we&rsquo;re now present in even more communities: Scotland, the North East, North West, West Midlands, East of England and Yorkshire. In these places, the excellence of our work means we&rsquo;re the preferred choice of partner for many local authorities, who trust us to provide a high quality and caring local service. Just as importantly, so do foster parents in these communities.</p>

Today, this still holds true &ndash; except we&rsquo;re now present in even more communities: Scotland, the North East, North West, West Midlands, East of England and Yorkshire. In these places, the excellence of our work means we&rsquo;re the preferred choice of partner for many local authorities, who trust us to provide a high quality and caring local service. Just as importantly, so do foster parents in these communities.</p>

ABOUT US</b></p>
<p>
Fostering People is a highly accredited community based fostering agency with over 20 years' experience of changing lives.</p>
<p>
Fostering People first opened its doors in 2000, when a local social worker came up with the idea of starting a new, independent fostering service in the East Midlands.</p>
<p>
Her idea was to provide plenty of excellent personal support, right in the heart of the local community. Today, this still holds true &ndash; except we&rsquo;re now present in even more communities: Scotland, the North East, North West, West Midlands, East of England and Yorkshire. In these places, the excellence of our work means we&rsquo;re the preferred choice of partner for many local authorities, who trust us to provide a high quality and caring local service. Just as importantly, so do foster parents in these communities.</p>
