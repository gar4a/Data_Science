Remote Work</b></h2>
<p>
The COVID-19 lockdowns accelerated our plans to become a remote-first company. Our team has transitioned fully to fully remote and there are no plans to return to the office. We heavily use remote collaboration tools. Although the path to remote-first includes an international team and no restrictions on working times, we're not quite ready for this yet.</p>
<p>
It is critical that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have a <b>quiet and comfortable</b> location where you can <b>work from home</b>, equipment can be provided.</li>
<li>You can travel occasionally (2-4 times a year) to a location in the East Midlands, UK.</li>
<li>You can work typical office times 09:00 to 17:30 (we've not transitioned to full flexible working)</li>
<li>Must be based <b>in the UK</b> permanently.</li>

We are not licensed to sponsor a visa</b> and we have no immediate plans to register for a license.</p>
