I'm looking for an experienced Power BI professional to join growing company based in Scotland - this role is largely remote, with occasional travel once or twice per month to their offices near Glasgow and in Aberdeenshire, depending on business requirements.<br>
<br>
In this role you'll work as part of a close-knit Business Intelligence team, and will lead on the transition from their current legacy reporting suite to Power BI. This will be your first major project in this role to help them really modernise their reporting set-up.
<br>
<br>
Going forward, you'll be working with stakeholders across the business to provide them with insightful Power BI reports that will impact commercial decision-making, and will play a critical role in helping the business to identify opportunities for improvement and fuel future growth.
<br>
<br>
As such, we're looking for a Power BI enthusiast who is very commercially-minded (i.e. has a real awareness of the commercial value that data can bring to an organisation), and is keen to really help this business level-up from a reporting perspective.
<br>
<br>
Requirements:
<br>
<br>
<ul><li>Strong end-to-end Power BI development experience</li><li>Strong experience developing complex measures in DAX</li><li>Experience with SQL scripting</li><li>Experience working with data from a variety of sources</li><li>Data migration experience would be beneficial
</li><li>Excellent communication and stakeholder management skills</li></ul><br>
Benefits:<br>
<br>
<ul><li>Salary up to &pound;50,000 depending on experience</li><li>30 days annual leave - inclusive of bank holidays</li><li>Pension scheme - based on government guidance</li><li>EAP with Bupa</li></ul><br>
<br>
<br>
Please Note: This is a permanent role for UK residents only. This role does not offer Sponsorship. You must have the right to work in the UK with no restrictions. Some of our roles may be subject to successful background checks including a DBS and Credit Check.<br>

Power BI Developer / Commercial Analyst</b></div><p>
08122023VSNFI3_1702040813</p><div>
I'm looking for an experienced Power BI professional to join growing company based in Scotland - this role is largely remote, with occasional travel once or twice per month to their offices near Glasgow and in Aberdeenshire, depending on business requirements.<br>
<br>
In this role you'll work as part of a close-knit Business Intelligence team, and will lead on the transition from their current legacy reporting suite to Power BI. This will be your first major project in this role to help them really modernise their reporting set-up.
<br>
<br>
Going forward, you'll be working with stakeholders across the business to provide them with insightful Power BI reports that will impact commercial decision-making, and will play a critical role in helping the business to identify opportunities for improvement and fuel future growth.
<br>
<br>
As such, we're looking for a Power BI enthusiast who is very commercially-minded (i.e. has a real awareness of the commercial value that data can bring to an organisation), and is keen to really help this business level-up from a reporting perspective.

Power BI Developer / Commercial Analyst</b></div><p>
08122023VSNFI3_1702040813</p><div>
I'm looking for an experienced Power BI professional to join growing company based in Scotland - this role is largely remote, with occasional travel once or twice per month to their offices near Glasgow and in Aberdeenshire, depending on business requirements.<br>
<br>
In this role you'll work as part of a close-knit Business Intelligence team, and will lead on the transition from their current legacy reporting suite to Power BI. This will be your first major project in this role to help them really modernise their reporting set-up.
<br>
<br>
Going forward, you'll be working with stakeholders across the business to provide them with insightful Power BI reports that will impact commercial decision-making, and will play a critical role in helping the business to identify opportunities for improvement and fuel future growth.
<br>
<br>
As such, we're looking for a Power BI enthusiast who is very commercially-minded (i.e. has a real awareness of the commercial value that data can bring to an organisation), and is keen to really help this business level-up from a reporting perspective.

Power BI Developer / Commercial Analyst</b></div><p>
08122023VSNFI3_1702040813</p><div>
I'm looking for an experienced Power BI professional to join growing company based in Scotland - this role is largely remote, with occasional travel once or twice per month to their offices near Glasgow and in Aberdeenshire, depending on business requirements.<br>
<br>
In this role you'll work as part of a close-knit Business Intelligence team, and will lead on the transition from their current legacy reporting suite to Power BI. This will be your first major project in this role to help them really modernise their reporting set-up.
<br>
<br>
Going forward, you'll be working with stakeholders across the business to provide them with insightful Power BI reports that will impact commercial decision-making, and will play a critical role in helping the business to identify opportunities for improvement and fuel future growth.
<br>
<br>
As such, we're looking for a Power BI enthusiast who is very commercially-minded (i.e. has a real awareness of the commercial value that data can bring to an organisation), and is keen to really help this business level-up from a reporting perspective.

I'm looking for an experienced Power BI professional to join growing company based in Scotland - this role is largely remote, with occasional travel once or twice per month to their offices near Glasgow and in Aberdeenshire, depending on business requirements.<br>
<br>
In this role you'll work as part of a close-knit Business Intelligence team, and will lead on the transition from their current legacy reporting suite to Power BI. This will be your first major project in this role to help them really modernise their reporting set-up.

<br>
<ul><li>Strong end-to-end Power BI development experience</li><li>Strong experience developing complex measures in DAX</li><li>Experience with SQL scripting</li><li>Experience working with data from a variety of sources</li><li>Data migration experience would be beneficial

Power BI Developer / Commercial Analyst</b></div><p>
08122023VSNFI3_1702040813</p><div>
I'm looking for an experienced Power BI professional to join growing company based in Scotland - this role is largely remote, with occasional travel once or twice per month to their offices near Glasgow and in Aberdeenshire, depending on business requirements.<br>
<br>
In this role you'll work as part of a close-knit Business Intelligence team, and will lead on the transition from their current legacy reporting suite to Power BI. This will be your first major project in this role to help them really modernise their reporting set-up.
<br>
<br>
Going forward, you'll be working with stakeholders across the business to provide them with insightful Power BI reports that will impact commercial decision-making, and will play a critical role in helping the business to identify opportunities for improvement and fuel future growth.
<br>
<br>
As such, we're looking for a Power BI enthusiast who is very commercially-minded (i.e. has a real awareness of the commercial value that data can bring to an organisation), and is keen to really help this business level-up from a reporting perspective.

<br>
<br>
Requirements:
<br>
<br>
<ul><li>Strong end-to-end Power BI development experience</li><li>Strong experience developing complex measures in DAX</li><li>Experience with SQL scripting</li><li>Experience working with data from a variety of sources</li><li>Data migration experience would be beneficial
</li><li>Excellent communication and stakeholder management skills</li></ul><br>
