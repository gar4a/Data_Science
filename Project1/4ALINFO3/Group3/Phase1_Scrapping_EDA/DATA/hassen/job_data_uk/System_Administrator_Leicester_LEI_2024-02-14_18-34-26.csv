<div></div><div><div><p><b>Working Arrangements &amp; Further Information</b></p><p>
The MoJ offers Hybrid Working arrangements where business need allows. This is an informal, non-contractual form of flexible working that blends working from your base location, different MoJ sites and / or from home (please be aware that this role can only be worked in the UK and not overseas). Some roles will not be suitable for Hybrid Working. Similarly, Hybrid Working will not suit everyone&rsquo;s circumstances. Arrangements will be discussed and agreed with the successful candidate(s) and subject to regular review.</p><p>
For nationally advertised roles, the successful candidate(s) will be appointed to a MoJ office location, which may include their nearest Justice Collaboration Centre or Justice Satellite Office. This will be discussed and agreed on the completion of pre-employment checks.</p><p>
Some of MoJ&rsquo;s terms and conditions of service are changing as part of Civil Service reform. The changes will apply to staff joining MoJ who are new to the Civil Service. Staff joining MoJ from other civil service employers will transfer onto the new MoJ terms if they are already on 'modernised' terms in their current post or onto 'unmodernised' MoJ terms if they are on 'unmodernised' terms at their current post. Details will be available if an offer is made.</p><p>
Standard working hours for this post are 37 hours per week excluding breaks which are unpaid.</p><p>
If you are a current NPS employee, this vacancy may be available on a Loan basis for up to 2 years. Applications are invited from suitable qualified staff.</p><p>
The Loan/Secondment is subject to the approval of the selected candidate's Business Unit, which should be obtained before confirmation of appointment.</p><p><b>
Benefits</b></p><p><b>
Annual Leave</b></p><ul><li>The holiday year runs from 1 March. If you work a non standard work pattern your leave entitlement may be expressed in either hours or days as appropriate. Leave entitlement is calculated on a pro-rata basis and you will be advised of your actual entitlement on appointment. If you were appointed internally and your leave was previously calculated in days, this will continue to be the case.</li></ul><p><b>
Bank, Public and Privilege Holidays</b></p><ul><li>You are entitled to 9 days (66 hours 36 minutes) in recognition of bank, public and privilege holidays. These hours are added to your annual leave allowance. There is a requirement to work some public and bank holidays subject to your shift pattern and the operational needs of the establishment</li></ul><p><b>
Pension</b></p><ul><li>The Civil Service offers a choice of two pension schemes, giving you the flexibility to choose the pension that suits you best.</li></ul><p><b>
Work Life Balance</b></p><p>
HM Prison &amp; Probation Service (HMPPS) is keen to encourage alternative working arrangements. Work life balance provides greater opportunities for staff to work more flexibly wherever managers and establishments can accommodate requests to do so. HMPPS offers flexible working subject to completion of a satisfactory probationary period and NVQ</p><p><b>
Season Ticket Advance</b></p><ul><li>After two months&rsquo; service, you&rsquo;ll be eligible to apply for a season ticket advance to purchase a quarterly or longer-period season ticket for travel between home and your place of work</li></ul><p><b>

Today, this still holds true &ndash; except we&rsquo;re now present in even more communities: Scotland, the North East, North West, West Midlands, East of England and Yorkshire. In these places, the excellence of our work means we&rsquo;re the preferred choice of partner for many local authorities, who trust us to provide a high quality and caring local service. Just as importantly, so do foster parents in these communities.</p>
