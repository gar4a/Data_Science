Job description</b></h3><div><p>
We are looking for a Senior Software Developer with Django and Python skills to work within an Azure DevOps environment. This is essentially an operational role, involving developing and maintaining the Institute Data System (IDS). IDS is a Django based internal workflow/case management platform that records information on the current status of IfATE technical products and processes to support core decision making. It also provides key reports and analysis, as well as a document store.</p><p>
IDS was originally designed to support the development of apprenticeship standards, but now also supports the much wider set of products that IfATE manages, including HTQs and post-16 qualifications, T-levels, Occupational maps and Occupational standards.
<br>
<br>
The role sits within the IDS Team, which is part of the wider Digital and Analytical Services (DAS). As well as being responsible for IDS, DAS supports evidence-led decision making throughout IfATE by providing data, insight and analysis to the board and its sub committees using a mixture of coding, statistics and domain expertise.</p><p>
The ideal candidate should possess a combination of Django and Python expertise and experience with Azure DevOps tools and practices.

We believe there are just a few simple things needed to create great software: state of the art technology, a continuously delivering pipeline of code, a purpose, a relaxed working environment, and most importantly a like minded team of people.
</p><p>We take an hybrid-agile approach to product development, forgoing the traditional vertical structure of management, meaning that even our newest developers will be given opportunities and encouraged to lead and learn.
</p><p><b>We're looking for software engineers who share our passion for code</b>. We're primarily a PHP team, but we're strong believers that language doesn't matter - the kind of software engineer we're looking for will be able to create magic, regardless of the language however previous experience in our tools will be a bonus.</p>

We use an array of tools, technologies and frameworks including:</p>
<ul>

<li>PHPUnit
</li><li>Git &amp; GitHub</li>
<li>YouTrack</li>

We release multiple times a day through a fully automated release pipeline, this is development in the fast lane and there is no room to dawdle.</p>

Ultimately, we want people who have a compulsion to solve problems, that thrive at being challenged, crave knowledge, aspire to be the best, a desire to deliver value, and most of all, people who have a real passion for the work. <i>People just like us</i>.</p>

</div><p>Viva IT is an innovative and exciting fintech. We specialise in creating mobile app and web-based financial software. Although we have a fully remote workforce, we are centred in the East Midlands, UK.</p>
<p>
We believe there are just a few simple things needed to create great software: state of the art technology, a continuously delivering pipeline of code, a purpose, a relaxed working environment, and most importantly a like minded team of people.
</p><p>We take an hybrid-agile approach to product development, forgoing the traditional vertical structure of management, meaning that even our newest developers will be given opportunities and encouraged to lead and learn.
</p><p><b>We're looking for software engineers who share our passion for code</b>. We're primarily a PHP team, but we're strong believers that language doesn't matter - the kind of software engineer we're looking for will be able to create magic, regardless of the language however previous experience in our tools will be a bonus.</p>
<p>
We use an array of tools, technologies and frameworks including:</p>
<ul>
<li>PHP 8.2</li>
<li>Symfony LTS releases including: 5.4 and 6.4</li>
<li>MySQL
</li><li>React</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>PHPUnit
</li><li>Git &amp; GitHub</li>
<li>YouTrack</li>
<li>TeamCity
</li><li>PHPStorm
</li></ul><p>Exposure to these tools is always favourable, but as an engineer we're sure you'll relish the opportunity to learn new technology and use new tools. We release multiple times a day through a fully automated release pipeline, this is development in the fast lane and there is no room to dawdle.</p>
<p>
Ultimately, we want people who have a compulsion to solve problems, that thrive at being challenged, crave knowledge, aspire to be the best, a desire to deliver value, and most of all, people who have a real passion for the work. <i>People just like us</i>.</p>

We believe there are just a few simple things needed to create great software: state of the art technology, a continuously delivering pipeline of code, a purpose, a relaxed working environment, and most importantly a like minded team of people.
</p><p>We take an hybrid-agile approach to product development, forgoing the traditional vertical structure of management, meaning that even our newest developers will be given opportunities and encouraged to lead and learn.
</p><p><b>We're looking for software engineers who share our passion for code</b>. We're primarily a PHP team, but we're strong believers that language doesn't matter - the kind of software engineer we're looking for will be able to create magic, regardless of the language however previous experience in our tools will be a bonus.</p>

We use an array of tools, technologies and frameworks including:</p>
<ul>
<li>PHP 8.2</li>

<li>PHPUnit
</li><li>Git &amp; GitHub</li>
<li>YouTrack</li>

We believe there are just a few simple things needed to create great software: state of the art technology, a continuously delivering pipeline of code, a purpose, a relaxed working environment, and most importantly a like minded team of people.
</p><p>We take an hybrid-agile approach to product development, forgoing the traditional vertical structure of management, meaning that even our newest developers will be given opportunities and encouraged to lead and learn.
</p><p><b>We're looking for software engineers who share our passion for code</b>. We're primarily a PHP team, but we're strong believers that language doesn't matter - the kind of software engineer we're looking for will be able to create magic, regardless of the language however previous experience in our tools will be a bonus.</p>

We use an array of tools, technologies and frameworks including:</p>
<ul>
<li>PHP 8.2</li>

<li>YouTrack</li>
