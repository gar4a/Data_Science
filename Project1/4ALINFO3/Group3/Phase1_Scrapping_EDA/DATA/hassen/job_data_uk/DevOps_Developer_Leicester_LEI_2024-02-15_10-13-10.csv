Job description</b></h3><div><p>
We are looking for a Senior Software Developer with Django and Python skills to work within an Azure DevOps environment. This is essentially an operational role, involving developing and maintaining the Institute Data System (IDS). IDS is a Django based internal workflow/case management platform that records information on the current status of IfATE technical products and processes to support core decision making. It also provides key reports and analysis, as well as a document store.</p><p>
IDS was originally designed to support the development of apprenticeship standards, but now also supports the much wider set of products that IfATE manages, including HTQs and post-16 qualifications, T-levels, Occupational maps and Occupational standards.
<br>
<br>
The role sits within the IDS Team, which is part of the wider Digital and Analytical Services (DAS). As well as being responsible for IDS, DAS supports evidence-led decision making throughout IfATE by providing data, insight and analysis to the board and its sub committees using a mixture of coding, statistics and domain expertise.</p><p>
The ideal candidate should possess a combination of Django and Python expertise and experience with Azure DevOps tools and practices. They will be expected to operate with a high degree of autonomy, championing the effective use of data and analytical evidence across the institute. This will require a clear understanding of quality assurance, risk and project management to ensure successful delivery across the full range of responsibilities.</p><p>
IfATE is going through an exciting period of transformation as it takes on more responsibility to reshape the technical education landscape. We are currently embarking on an ambitious plan for our digital services that will transform our systems and processes over the next 3 years. The successful candidate will be asked to get involved in this activity alongside the 'day job' and work with third parties and other stakeholders to support transition from the legacy systems to the new.</p><p>
We are looking for a motivated and pro-active senior software developer who can deliver at pace, working both independently and as part of a team. The successful candidate will be experienced in Python and Django and will care about code quality.</p><p>
As a Senior Software Developer, you will:</p><ul><li>
Help to improve and develop the Institute Data Service (IDS) in order to support the expanding responsibilities of the Institute, working within an agile environment.</li><li>
Understand the whole IDS system and take responsibility for teaching this to others where appropriate.</li><li>
Apply your experience of full stack web application development technologies and front-end languages.</li><li>
Work in cloud-based environments (Azure).</li><li>
Design, test, and improve software that meets user needs, writing clean, secure code that is of a high quality and is easy for others to reuse.</li><li>
Find ways to improve the system robustness, resilience and stability.</li><li>
Help improve the links between IDS and the other digital services used by IfATE.</li><li>
Identify process optimisation opportunities and propose and implement solutions.</li></ul><p>
Benefits of the role include:</p><ul><li>
Space to learn and develop in order to further your career. This job is in line with the Senior Software Developer role described by the Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) Profession Capability Framework (see https://www.gov.uk/guidance/software-developer for further information). Following this framework will enable the successful candidate to identify skills that need development to help career progression and to later move into other software development roles across the Civil Service.</li><li>
Exposure to a wide variety of interesting projects across the entire organisation.</li><li>
Ability to work with a relatively large amount of autonomy and influence. We are open to new ideas and keen to continually improve the way we do things.</li></ul></div></div><div><h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Person specification</b></h3><div><p><b>
Essential Criteria:</b></p><ul><li>
Proven ability to deliver complex software solutions in a multi-disciplinary agile team.</li><li>
Experience of full stack web application development technologies including Django, Python, REST APIs, PostgreSQL and front-end languages.</li><li>
Proficiency with key Azure DevOps tools including Azure DevOps Services, repos, pipelines, artifacts and boards.</li><li>
Ability to set up and manage Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).</li><li>
Proficiency in Git workflows, including feature branching, pull requests and code reviews.</li><li>
Strong problem-solving skills for debugging and addressing issues and the ability to communicate the impact and potential resolutions of technical messages effectively.</li></ul><p><b>

Proficient in creating clear and comprehensive documentation for both code and deployment processes.</li><li>
Knowledge of testing and quality assurance methodologies within the CI/CD pipeline.</li><li>
Experience of using GDS design.</li></ul><p>
Desirable criteria will only be assessed in the event of a tie between candidates.</p><p>
Working flexibly is important to the success of the IfATE, and while you will have specific responsibilities as set out above, you will be part of a &lsquo;one team&rsquo; approach and may be asked to be involved in a range of other activities. As new areas of work progress, you may be asked to move between teams to deliver the IfATE&rsquo;s key priorities.</p></div></div><div><p>
Benefits</p></div><div><div>
Alongside your salary of &pound;53,775, Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education contributes &pound;14,519 towards you being a member of the Civil Service Defined Benefit Pension scheme. Find out what benefits a Civil Service Pension provides.</div></div><div><div><p>
