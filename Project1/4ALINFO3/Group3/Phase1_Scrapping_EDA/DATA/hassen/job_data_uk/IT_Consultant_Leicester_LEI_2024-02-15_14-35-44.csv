Applications are invited for an enthusiastic and committed Consultant Paediatrician with general, diabetes and endocrine and neonatal experience who will work to further enhance the hospital based paediatric and neonatal services, assist in managing the increasing clinical and administrative workload and help achieve the 'facing the future' standards set out by the RCPCH.

<br><br>
The Consultants operate a Paediatrician of the week rota for the Children’s wards. Following the weekend on-call commencing Friday 1 pm, all general paediatric and neonatal admissions are admitted under the duty paediatrician. The Paediatrician of the week is responsible for all paediatric in-patient Paediatric admissions during the week and for all Paediatric emergencies during regular working hours, with out of hour’s on-call shared amongst the consultant colleagues. Attendance at morning and evening handover is expected. Clinics are cancelled during the Duty Paediatrician week to provide full ward / emergency cover.

The weekday on call cover includes on site presence in the evening, (usually until 19.00 hours, longer in winter).
<br><br>
There is scope to have a dedicated time in the job plan to enhance and further develop the sub-speciality service delivery alongside the transformation programme.

Up to 45k (depending on experience), plus overtime (Up to 55-60k)</b></p><p>
Get bored of being stuck in the same place? Fancy opportunities to travel the UK and more?</p><p>
You'll already know what a service engineer does. You travel from site to site, fault finding, servicing and maintaining. You'll be doing a similar role here, but on LASERs.</p><p>
Imagine telling your friends down the pub you work with lasers?!</p><p>
After a &pound;4 billion global turnover for 2022, the company is looking to invest in new members of their UK service team.</p><p>
You might not know anything about lasers, and that's ok. This role provides an intensive product specific course on Industrial Laser Machinery in Germany! What's more, PLC training is also included!</p><p>
So, whether it's your first steps into engineering or simply a career or industry change, this could be for you.</p><p>
The business wants to look after you. So, as well as training and a good salary, they'll also give you a van and milage cover, 33 days holiday that increases with service and bonuses on length of time served.</p><p><b>
What do I need?</b></p><p>
You might not have worked with lasers before, but you'll already have maintenance experience. This could be in manufacturing, aerospace or automotive - whatever you've done, this could be the next step for you.</p><p>
There is job specific training on offer, but you'll already have a good knowledge base through a recognised Electrical or Mechanical Engineering Qualification.</p><p>
This role will see you travelling across the UK, so nights away will be required. At least hotel beds are comfortable (and paid for) though!</p><p>
A UK driving licence is essential, but that's a given as you'll be spending your time on the road, and you get a van with the job.</p><p><b>
What business will I be a part of?</b></p><p>
They are one of the largest industrial laser manufacturers on the planet with teams in the UK, Europe, North and South America, Asia and Pacific, and Australia! Providing ample opportunity to explore the world.</p><p>
What better place to advance your career than a global business?</p><p>
They are involved in multiple industries such as the Automotive, Aerospace, Plastics and FMCG sectors giving you plenty of variation and exposure to new areas of manufacturing.</p><p>
Not name dropping, but they work with the likes of Rolls Royce and JCB.</p><p>
</p><p><b>What's Next?</b></p><p>
Give me a call! Whether you're already hooked or fancy knowing just that little bit more. You can reach me, Ben at 01780480530 or email me at ben.gough@morepeople.co.uk. You can also drop me a message on LinkedIn if that's easier. Don't worry about having an up-to-date CV, we can sort that out later.</p></div></div><div></div>

#JoinTeamEliot
<br><br>
The successful candidate will join our team at a very exciting time. We have transformed the Paediatric model at Nuneaton which puts Clinicians leading and working together for career development at the heart of our service. Our vision is to provide first class consultant-delivered care to the children and families of Nuneaton and North Warwickshire.
<br><br>
The department has 8 Consultants, 6 middle grade doctors, 8 tier 1 junior doctors and 3 advanced practitioner nurses in an integrated multi-professional model of care. A good general Paediatric and Neonatal background is the priority and practical skills are essential. Special interests to complement the team are welcomed and in addition the opportunity exists for further on the job development.
<br><br>
In this new model consultants are resident on call at night, at the weekend. During the week the middle grade tier are resident on site with the consultant available from home after 21.30. There is also a tier one of junior doctors and physicians associates as well as rostered support from advanced clinical practitioners both in Paediatrics and neonatal care. The resident nature of the evening and night work provides for substantial time off during the week because daytime activity is adjusted accordingly - detailed in the example work schedule Acute Paediatric Service.
<br>There is no Paediatric inpatient ward at Nuneaton and ambulances convey directly to UHCW hospital.
<br><br>
Here at George Eliot our vision to ‘ excel at patient care’ takes centre stage. An ever evolving clinically-led acute service provider we are on a journey to continually provide high quality, safe and responsive services delivered by inspiring, friendly and compassionate staff who share our corporate values which underpin everything we do. Our values are not just words on a piece of paper, they bond us together, reflect our ambition and shape who we are:
<br><br>
E ffective Open Communication
<br><br>
e x cellence and safety in everything we do
<br><br>
C hallenge but support
<br><br>
E xpect respect and dignity
<br><br>
L ocal health that inspires confidence
<br><br>
<b>Benefits:</b> On-site nursery, 27 days minimum annual leave plus bank holidays, cycle to work scheme, flexible working, extensive in-house course learning directory, buying and selling of annual leave, subsidised restaurant, tranquillity garden and generous subsidised on-site parking.
<br><br>
To provide, with Consultant colleagues, general Paediatric and Neonatal services within George Eliot NHS Trust for the prevention, diagnosis and management of illness and the proper functioning of the department
<br><br>
To undertake General Paediatric Outpatient Clinics and other special interest clinics as appropriate to the skills/interests of the post holder and as agreed at annual Job Planning
<br><br>
The post holder undertakes to perform additional duties in occasional emergencies and unforeseen circumstances
<br><br>
Undertake administrative duties associated with the care of patients (including activity data as required) in line with Trust Policy.
<br><br>
There is scope for a motivated consultant to take the lead in shaping the future of the service and for special interests to complement the team including cardiology and safeguarding.
<br><br>
About the Team and the Trust
<br><br>
The Children’s Department is undergoing significant changes in the next few months. There are dedicated clinical areas:
<br><br>
Level 1 Special Care Baby Unit within the Consultant Led Maternity Unit.
<br><br>
CAU, currently located within ED but with aspirations for development.
<br><br>
Outpatient Clinics
<br><br>
Nuneaton itself offers all the advantages of urban living with easy access to the beautiful countryside nearby and good wider transport links. The George Eliot serves a population of about 300,000 from Nuneaton & Bedworth, North Warwickshire, South West Leicestershire and Northern Coventry. It serves a catchment population between the major hospitals in Coventry, Leicester and East Birmingham and has good working links with the specialist services at tertiary units in Birmingham and Leicester.
<br><br>
The region has very reasonable house prices, and a large choice of very good state and private sector schools in the area, make this an ideal setting for a family home. There are numerous villages within easy driving distance of the hospital for those who prefer a rural setting. It’s a great place to bring up a family, have a great quality of life and a great place to work.
<br><br>
We are committed to balance well-being and professional interest throughout a career in Paediatrics at the George Eliot. We are delighted to offer an interesting yet life-style compatible 1:8 Consultant of the Week rota. This consultant is responsible for all the patients seen by the Paediatric team in the hospital for a consecutive period of either 4 week days (Monday - Thursday) or 3 weekend days (Friday – Sunday). The week is split to provide better work-life balance. The Consultant of the Week will have no other routine commitments such as clinics. An example 10PA work schedule is included in the Job Description.
<br><br>
The post is offered on a full-time basis; however, the Trust would welcome discussion with individuals looking for a more flexible working pattern to support a different work life balance. The post-holder (full-time or part-time) will be expected to take part in the full on-call rota."

<p></p><p>Full-time Consultant with a responsibility to Adult Critical Care at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust.</p>

As part of the intensive neurorehabilitation provided on-site at Burton Park, there is a large emphasis placed upon community rehabilitation in order to prepare the patient to move back to their local area as independently as is possible.</p>
<p>Burton Park is situated in the historic town of Melton Mowbray, a thriving market town. Here patients can access local amenities such as a leisure centre, cinema, shops, restaurants and caf&eacute;s to support their full rehabilitation programme. The TDT includes full time Neuropsychologists, Psychiatrists. Occupational Therapists, Physiotherapist, Speech and Language Therapists, Social Work along with Qualified Nurses and Rehabilitation Assistants. Outcome measures are routinely collected and individual&rsquo;s progress tracked.</p>
<p>Burton Park boasts a range of facilities utilised by the TDT and patients as they work through their specialist individual rehabilitation plan.</p>
<p>The purpose of this post is to develop a newly or recently qualified SLT who will be working and learning actively alongside the SLT Team to deliver and enhance the Speech and Language Therapy service across site. You will be undertaking clinical and administrative duties in line with the role and practising within the remit of the Health and Care Professions Council Standards of Practice.</p>
<p>Presently, the Speech and Language Therapy team consists of two Speech and Language Therapists, one a Generalist SLT (newly qualified and full-time) and the other a Consultant Specialist Speech and Language Therapist (locum).</p>
<p>You would be working alongside both these SLTs. You would be supervised by the Consultant Speech and Language Therapist for all clinical aspects of the role, and would have access to day-to-day peer support from the other SLT on site. Operational supervision and management would be carried out by the Director of Clinical Services.</p>
<p>It is imperative that you have good and robust knowledge of acquired brain injury (ABI) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) and its impact on individuals and their families. As Burton Park is guided by principles in neuropsychology, you will need to be knowledgeable about the impact of mental health on communication difficulties and disorders. You will need to carry out initial assessments using evidence-based and person centered approaches. There&rsquo;s a real need to think creatively and outside the box. You will need to be confident in your approaches and be resilient in the face of behaviours that challenge. You will participate in ward rounds and in care-plan approach meetings. You will primarily be focusing on providing assessment, management and treatment of communication difficulties and disorders following brain injury. You will be eligible to grow within the role and undertake further opportunities such as specialist dysphagia training from approximately six-months in to the role. This will allow you to begin developing specialist skills in delivering a more comprehensive service through assessment, management and treatment regarding eating, drinking and swallowing disorders. You will also be able to participate in and deliver training for new starters from a communication perspective.</p>
<p>You will work with the SLT team to develop and enhance the provision already on site. You will be supported to prioritise a caseload and develop as a clinical practitioner. You will be supported to complete your newly qualified competencies (RCSLT) by both your peer SLT and the Consultant SLT. It is imperative that you take the lead alongside the other SLTs in promoting and raising awareness across site around best practices in communication and supporting communication with individuals with brain injury.</p></div>"

</p></div></div><div><div><b>About the Role</b><b>
</b><div><b>1</b></div><b><br>
</b></div><div><div><p>Warwick Medical School (WMS) at the University of Warwick wishes to appoint a Research Fellow to develop statistical methods for analysing adaptive platform trials.</p><p>
The exciting project is funded by MRC-NIHR Better Methods for Better Research Programme for 3 years. Salary will be within the range &pound;33,966 - &pound;44,263 per annum, depending on qualifications and experience, plus a market supplement of &pound;5,000 per annum.</p><p>
You will develop methods to analyse adaptative platform trials whilst addressing statistical challenges the analysis pose. Platform trials are multi-arm, that is, multiple experimental treatments are tested, and are multi-stage, that is, multiple interim analyses are performed to adapt the trial based on accrued evidence. Therefore, there is a challenge to adjust analysis for multiplicity arising from multiple treatments and multiple interim analyses. New experimental treatments may also be added partway through a platform trial. This poses additional challenge of whether, whilst comparing an added treatment to the control treatment, patients randomised to the control treatment before adding the treatment should be included, and if so, how. Other challenges include the fact that the standard of care and hence control treatment may change during the trial. Analytic and simulations techniques will be used.</p><p>
You will work with Principal Investigator Dr Peter Kimani based in Warwick Clinical Trials Unit (WCTU) in WMS, Prof Nigel Stallard, Professor of Medical statistics and Director of WCTU, Prof Keith Abrams, Professor of Statistics &amp; Data Science in the Department of Statistics in the University of Warwick, Prof Andrew Metcalfe, an orthopaedic surgeon and a Professor of Clinical Trials in WCTU and Prof Jeremy Chataway, a consultant neurologist and Co-Programme Lead for Neurodegenerative Diseases at the UCL MRC Trials Unit.</p><p>
To support you develop a long-term research programme, you will be encouraged, in collaboration with colleagues in WCTU and wider WMS and university, to lead or contribute to grant applications to generate further funding.</p><p>
The post is primarily research, but there will be opportunities for teaching and assisting in the supervision of postgraduate students.</p>
</div>
</div></div><div><div><b>About You</b><b>
</b><div><b>1</b></div><b><br>
</b></div><div><div><p>You possess a PhD or equivalent qualification in statistics or a closely related subject or work experience with expertise in the development of statistical methodology for clinical trial design and analysis and interest or experience in adaptive design methods and meta-analysis. You should also have excellent communication and team-working skills required for a successful collaborative project. You may not possess a PhD if you have a track record of developing statistical analysis methods in medical research.</p><p></p><p><br>
If you are near submission or have recently submitted your PhD but have not yet had it conferred, any offers of employment will be made as Research Assistant at the top of level 5 of the University grade structure. Upon receipt of evidence of the successful award of your PhD, you will be promoted to Research Fellow on the first point of level 6 of the University grade structure.</p>
</div>
</div></div><div><div><b>About the Department</b><b>
</b><div><b>1</b></div><b><br>
</b></div><div><div><p>Based within Warwick Clinical Trials Unit (WCTU), you will be appointed at Warwick Medical School (WMS) at the University of Warwick. WCTU has a strong track record in delivering excellent research that inform clinical practice. Around 20 statisticians provide design and analysis expertise to WCTU&rsquo;s large portfolio of studies, mostly multicentre clinical trials. WCTU statisticians collaborate widely with other groups in WMS, the wider university such as the internationally renowned department of statistics and the local NHS Trust. Also, based on WCTU trials and individual research interests, they conduct applied statistical methodology research, with multiple ongoing projects funded by MRC-NIHR Better Methods for Better Research Programme.

As Tetra Tech builds on its demonstrable track record as one of the leading global environmental consultancies, we are seeking an assistant to join our team in the Midlands.

As a multidisciplinary consultancy, we work closely with colleagues from other teams including planning, placemaking, engineering, transportation and asset management - including through the identification of opportunities, tendering and project delivery. You will be proactive in developing relationships with colleagues from across the business, liaising with other teams on a regular basis and supporting them through stages of a project.</div><br>
<div></div>
<div>
We pride ourselves on our ability to offer professional ecology advice across a breadth of sectors including residential, defence, energy, government services and transport.

ATA Search (a leading Division of ATA Recruitment) are looking for the next team member to join our expanding team in 2024!</p><p>
Specialising in the identification, assessment and integration of executive candidates/leaders into Engineering companies across the UK and Internationally, ATA Search offers well-defined, innovative recruitment processes and methodologies to ensure a robust and value-adding service.</p><p>
This is a B2B consultative sales role, in which the successful candidate will be pitching for retained work for senior roles across the engineering sector, both in the UK and Internationally. Recruiting for Managers, Directors and Executives, you will manage them through (sometimes lengthy) hiring processes, working very closely with both candidate and client to ensure the desired outcome for both sides are achieved.</p><p>
This is an ideal opportunity for an experienced Recruitment Consultant looking to enhance their career prospects with a business that supports your development and encourages you to reach your full potential. You will be working alongside an experienced Manager, who has built this Division from the ground up, whilst still billing very substantially themselves &ndash; they have been ATA&rsquo;s overall top biller for the last 7 years and are on course to do this again in 2023!</p><p>
As the third person to join this division, you will be instrumental in shaping and developing its future. After learning &lsquo;The ATA Way&rsquo;, you will be given complete autonomy to define your own market, whether that be in the UK or Internationally, and you will have the opportunity to shape your own career. Our progression structure is built to suit everyone&rsquo;s aspirations and goals, meaning you can move into a management role if you wish, or stay in a stand-alone role, with continued development opportunities available to you. You will also be trained to become a certified Thomas International Practitioner, enhancing your ability to identify and recruit the best talent for your clients.</p><p>
We are looking for someone who has proven experience in either a 360-recruitment role, or a consultative B2B sales role. Due to the nature of the clients and candidates you will be speaking to, you will need to be highly articulate, confident and possess excellent communication and presentation skills. ATA Search strive to deliver an extremely professional service, underpinned by sector knowledge and recruitment expertise, so it is important that our successful candidate is committed to building their knowledge and developing their skills &ndash; individually and with our support.</p><p><b>

<p>
As an Apprentice, you will be employed, just like anyone else at the company, the only difference is that you spend some of your week studying towards a qualification.</p><br>
<p><b>
</b></p><p>Typically, you will have a teams meeting once a month (2-3 hours) with your assigned Trainer Assessor unlike the usual assumption that you will attend college for one day a week. Throughout the month, you will be expected to complete different assignments and independent study as discussed in this meeting in preparation for the next month. Each week, you will spend a minimum of 6 hours in a number of different Training, Learning &amp; Development Activities that all develop your Knowledge, Skills &amp; Behaviours which will be completed in your place of work during your working hours- so no homework!! These 6 hours will be agreed with your manager and can be set as a whole day or split throughout the week, whatever works best for you!
</p><p>After approximately 6 months, you will be set mock activities by your Trainer Assessor to help you prepare for your End Point Assessment (EPA). This will include Multiple Choice Questions, Presentations of your work and Q&amp;A&rsquo;s. You will receive lots of one-to-one support to prepare you for this!</p>
<p>
CT Skills is always sure to provide full support from your Initial Application to your final EPA! As we are a training provider, all of our vacancies are for immediate start and available all year round, so please consider this when you are applying!</p>

</li></ul><ul><li>Using a recruitment-based system to log all communications</li></ul>
<div></div><div>The successful candidate must be self-motivated and capable of building strong client and candidate relationships. You will also need the determination to identify suitable candidates from a variety of sources in a shortage profession and consequently competitive market. We are a small, friendly, close knit bunch so you will need to be a team player working hard to provide recruitment solutions whilst developing lasting relationships with both our clients and candidates. You will also need a working knowledge of how to use various social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. Due to the nature of the work you will need to have excellent communication skills, ambition and dedication to succeed in a fast-paced and competitive environment.</div>
<div></div><div>Benefits:

</li></ul><div></div><div>We need people who are not easily disheartened. We want people who can provide innovative solutions to complex problems and explain the logic behind it.

<div><br>
We're an unconventional option. We're not arrogant. We work together. We succeed and fail together. And we're building something special.</div><br>
<div><br>
Will it be tough? YES!!<br>
</div><div><br>
We do all the nice stuff too of course... Team building, staff holidays, dogs in the office, dress down day every day, monthly 'Star' awards, we have free parking etc etc etc, but you can learn all the good bits over a coffee with us.</div><br>
<div><br>
Will it be worth it? ABSOLUTELY...</div></div></div></div></div><div></div>"

Crucial to all applicants will be enthusiasm, ability to work as part of a team and a good work ethic.

Crucial to all applicants will be enthusiasm, ability to work as part of a team and a good work ethic.

Perhaps your current employer is struggling to focus fully on Intacct alongside more traditional Sage products? Perhaps you don't have a Intacct 'team' to bounce off?

Crucial to all applicants will be enthusiasm, ability to work as part of a team and a good work ethic.

Perhaps your current employer is struggling to focus fully on Intacct alongside more traditional Sage products? Perhaps you don't have a Intacct 'team' to bounce off?

This is NOT a trainee position so the successful candidate should have a proven track record of Sage 200 implementations, along with a working knowledge of the add-on market. Knowledge of the Sicon product range and/or Manufacturing (Sage 200 or Sicon) is particularly desirable.</p><p>
Crucial to all applicants will be enthusiasm, ability to work as part of a team and a good work ethic. Customer service is very important to our company, so a customer-first attitude and a strong desire to produce quality projects are also essential.</p><h5 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b><br>
Why Smith Cooper?</b></h5><p>
In return, we can offer, a great company with a clear growth plan and the appetite to execute it, a great working environment/team ethos plus lots of great projects to get stuck into immediately.</p><p>
Again, this is NOT a trainee role. However, the opportunity to develop your career with our company will be significant for anyone who can contribute to our positive, forward-thinking environment. We also have a proven track record of internal promotion.</p><p>
We operate a flexible working policy and, due to the current climate, the majority of our consultancy team are now largely home-based. As such, all geographies are welcome. However, candidates based in the Midlands or the South of England would be at a distinct advantage.</p><p>
If you are an experienced Sage 200 consultant who is bored or undervalued in your current role, is in between jobs due to the current economic climate or just simply fancy a new challenge, then please get in touch.</p></div>"
