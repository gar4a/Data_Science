About the Role</b></h3><p>
In today's world, where data plays a big role, having high-quality data is particularly important. It helps us get accurate insights and make better decisions. While current solutions in the market can identify data quality issues based on pre-defined rules, these approaches are limited and incapable of correcting these errors, supported by a set of confidence measures to ensure the accuracy of the corrected entries. The aim of this exciting KTP project between Nottingham Trent University and Bigspark Limited is to revolutionize the way organisations handle and leverage their data by employing innovative techniques based on Artificial Intelligence to perform data imputation and correction. This will empower businesses with high-quality, accurate and timely data for effective decision-making.</p><p>
The expected outcome of this project are as follows:</p><ul><li>
Develop innovative AI/ML solution for identifying data quality issues.</li><li>
Integrate the developed solution to existing platforms to improve data quality by identifying outliers and possible corrective measures.</li><li>
Develop explainable AI models to improve transparency and trust of the developed solutions.</li><li>
Embed the technical knowledge into the company and develop a knowledge for future adaptation of the project outcomes</li></ul><p>
The overall purpose of the KTP associate role is to lead the successful development and integration ML-based data quality enhancement solution that is applicable in the financial sector. This will allow BigSpark to utilise this tool as part of their development toolchain, resulting in an efficient and timely data correction measures.</p></div></div><div></div><div><div><h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Who is bigspark?</b></h3><p>
Bigspark is a fast-growing UK data solutions consultancy transforming businesses and igniting</p><p>
change through engineering and data-fuelled innovation. Our agile team of over 50 data engineers</p><p>
and scientists approaches complex challenges with an audacious mindset, pushing boundaries to</p><p>
unlock the power within data.</p><p>
We proudly offer our services to leading organizations in finance like NatWest, Esure, and in</p><p>
mental health, like MyNara. We are constantly pushing our expertise forward across data</p><p>
engineering, science, AI, cloud, software, and financial crime technology. For each client, our</p><p>
dedicated teams get deep into the details of their business to deliver top-notch tailored solutions.</p><p>
Leveraging our extensive experience serving financial sector clients, we aim to use our data</p><p>
quality expertise to solve critical problems such as improving the accuracy and completeness of</p><p>
financial data, which is one of the main causes of poor decision making that can lead to</p><p>
significant financial losses or compliance issues for organizations.</p><p>
Most data quality solutions tend to have a narrow focus, with limited capabilities to address</p><p>
emerging data quality issues like bias or concept drift; and also lack automation. With many tools</p><p>

We&rsquo;re a team after all.</p>
<p>
When you&rsquo;re working with the other developers and helping them out on code deploys, you&rsquo;ll be working in your familiar environments of GitHub, BuildKite, and Docker. We love open source and expect that you do too if you&rsquo;re reading this.</p>
<p>
The August team is smart and nimble; working together to help our clients change and build innovative applications. We are committed to learning and sharing something new every day.</p>
<p>
While we expect this to be a full time role, we&rsquo;re always open to chatting about part time options.</p>
<p>
DevOps Engineers work within our diverse team to ensure our infrastructure is top notch and our clients are receiving the best experience we can provide them. We are fixated on improving our clients&rsquo; outcomes. We expect that you&rsquo;re someone who values this as well.</p>

About the Role</b></h3>
<p>
We're looking for software architects with broad technical knowledge, full life-cycle project experience and excellent communication skills to bridge the gap between client and engineering teams.</p>

How should our application architecture change and what supporting infrastructure do I need as we migrate to the Cloud?</b></p>

About the Role</b></h3>
<p>
We're looking for software architects with broad technical knowledge, full life-cycle project experience and excellent communication skills to bridge the gap between client and engineering teams.</p>

How should our application architecture change and what supporting infrastructure do I need as we migrate to the Cloud?</b></p>

How do we maintain conceptual integrity of our product design as it rapidly evolves?</b></p>

How can we quickly deliver the robust legacy system interfaces needed by our Agile development teams?</b></p>

These are the types of questions that you'll be asked by our clients, your colleagues and yourself at BJSS.</p>
<p>
BJSS has developed some of the most demanding systems around using the latest technologies and techniques &ndash; from the messaging hub that integrates the whole of the NHS, to an application that uses a leading-edge AWS technology stack to underpin a great UX visualising the flightpaths of every plane in the world &ndash; as well as analysing huge quantities of data to improve fuel efficiency, reducing costs and environmental impact.

<p>
As a technical authority, you lead by example and inspire delivery teams to create great software products that demonstrate the art of the possible. You mentor developers to ensure they see the wider picture and meet our exacting standards, while acknowledging the deep experience they bring from spending hours a day working on a codebase.</p>
<p>
You have energy and a pragmatic, delivery-focused attitude that wins the respect of those around you and makes you a trusted technical advisor. You're willing to be hands-on when you need to be. You balance innovation and intellectual rigour with realism. You love technology and want to keep on learning.

About the Role</b></h3>
<p>
We're looking for software architects with broad technical knowledge, full life-cycle project experience and excellent communication skills to bridge the gap between client and engineering teams.</p>

How should our application architecture change and what supporting infrastructure do I need as we migrate to the Cloud?</b></p>

How do we maintain conceptual integrity of our product design as it rapidly evolves?</b></p>

How can we quickly deliver the robust legacy system interfaces needed by our Agile development teams?</b></p>

These are the types of questions that you'll be asked by our clients, your colleagues and yourself at BJSS.</p>

BJSS has developed some of the most demanding systems around using the latest technologies and techniques &ndash; from the messaging hub that integrates the whole of the NHS, to an application that uses a leading-edge AWS technology stack to underpin a great UX visualising the flightpaths of every plane in the world &ndash; as well as analysing huge quantities of data to improve fuel efficiency, reducing costs and environmental impact.

<p>
As a technical authority, you lead by example and inspire delivery teams to create great software products that demonstrate the art of the possible. You mentor developers to ensure they see the wider picture and meet our exacting standards, while acknowledging the deep experience they bring from spending hours a day working on a codebase.</p>
<p>
You have energy and a pragmatic, delivery-focused attitude that wins the respect of those around you and makes you a trusted technical advisor. You're willing to be hands-on when you need to be. You balance innovation and intellectual rigour with realism. You love technology and want to keep on learning.

About the Role</b></h3>
<p>
We're looking for software architects with broad technical knowledge, full life-cycle project experience and excellent communication skills to bridge the gap between client and engineering teams.</p>

How should our application architecture change and what supporting infrastructure do I need as we migrate to the Cloud?</b></p>

BJSS has developed some of the most demanding systems around using the latest technologies and techniques &ndash; from the messaging hub that integrates the whole of the NHS, to an application that uses a leading-edge AWS technology stack to underpin a great UX visualising the flightpaths of every plane in the world &ndash; as well as analysing huge quantities of data to improve fuel efficiency, reducing costs and environmental impact.

<p>
As a technical authority, you lead by example and inspire delivery teams to create great software products that demonstrate the art of the possible. You mentor developers to ensure they see the wider picture and meet our exacting standards, while acknowledging the deep experience they bring from spending hours a day working on a codebase.</p>

You have energy and a pragmatic, delivery-focused attitude that wins the respect of those around you and makes you a trusted technical advisor. You're willing to be hands-on when you need to be. You balance innovation and intellectual rigour with realism. You love technology and want to keep on learning.

About the Role</b></h3>
<p>
We're looking for software architects with broad technical knowledge, full life-cycle project experience and excellent communication skills to bridge the gap between client and engineering teams.</p>

How should our application architecture change and what supporting infrastructure do I need as we migrate to the Cloud?</b></p>

How do we maintain conceptual integrity of our product design as it rapidly evolves?</b></p>

How can we quickly deliver the robust legacy system interfaces needed by our Agile development teams?</b></p>

What do I need to do to integrate data science models into our production business processes and unlock the value of our data?</b></p>

These are the types of questions that you'll be asked by our clients, your colleagues and yourself at BJSS.</p>
<p>
BJSS has developed some of the most demanding systems around using the latest technologies and techniques &ndash; from the messaging hub that integrates the whole of the NHS, to an application that uses a leading-edge AWS technology stack to underpin a great UX visualising the flightpaths of every plane in the world &ndash; as well as analysing huge quantities of data to improve fuel efficiency, reducing costs and environmental impact.

<p>
As a technical authority, you lead by example and inspire delivery teams to create great software products that demonstrate the art of the possible. You mentor developers to ensure they see the wider picture and meet our exacting standards, while acknowledging the deep experience they bring from spending hours a day working on a codebase.</p>
<p>
You have energy and a pragmatic, delivery-focused attitude that wins the respect of those around you and makes you a trusted technical advisor. You're willing to be hands-on when you need to be. You balance innovation and intellectual rigour with realism. You love technology and want to keep on learning.

We're an award-winning innovative tech consultancy - a team of creative problem solvers. Since 1993 we've been finding better, more sustainable ways to solve complex technology problems for some of the world's leading organisations and delivered solutions that millions of people use every day.</p>
<p>
In the last 30 years we won several awards, including a prestigious Queen's Award for Enterprise in the Innovation category for our Enterprise Agile delivery approach.</p>

About the Role</b></h3>
<p>
We're looking for software architects with broad technical knowledge, full life-cycle project experience and excellent communication skills to bridge the gap between client and engineering teams.</p>
<p><b>
How should our application architecture change and what supporting infrastructure do I need as we migrate to the Cloud?</b></p>
<p><b>
How do we maintain conceptual integrity of our product design as it rapidly evolves?</b></p>
<p><b>
How can we quickly deliver the robust legacy system interfaces needed by our Agile development teams?</b></p>
<p><b>
What do I need to do to integrate data science models into our production business processes and unlock the value of our data?</b></p>
<p>
These are the types of questions that you'll be asked by our clients, your colleagues and yourself at BJSS.</p>
<p>
BJSS has developed some of the most demanding systems around using the latest technologies and techniques &ndash; from the messaging hub that integrates the whole of the NHS, to an application that uses a leading-edge AWS technology stack to underpin a great UX visualising the flightpaths of every plane in the world &ndash; as well as analysing huge quantities of data to improve fuel efficiency, reducing costs and environmental impact. Our architects have always been at the centre of our engagements, managing technical risk and creating real business value.</p>

You'll be comfortable evaluating a new Open Source technology in a rapid technical spike, presenting to a CIO on a package selection, or working with a technical tester and a support desk engineer to debug a time-critical P1 issue.</p>
<p>
As a technical authority, you lead by example and inspire delivery teams to create great software products that demonstrate the art of the possible. You mentor developers to ensure they see the wider picture and meet our exacting standards, while acknowledging the deep experience they bring from spending hours a day working on a codebase.</p>
<p>
You have energy and a pragmatic, delivery-focused attitude that wins the respect of those around you and makes you a trusted technical advisor. You're willing to be hands-on when you need to be. You balance innovation and intellectual rigour with realism. You love technology and want to keep on learning.

<p>
We're an award-winning innovative tech consultancy - a team of creative problem solvers. Since 1993 we've been finding better, more sustainable ways to solve complex technology problems for some of the world's leading organisations and delivered solutions that millions of people use every day.</p>
<p>
In the last 30 years we won several awards, including a prestigious Queen's Award for Enterprise in the Innovation category for our Enterprise Agile delivery approach.</p>
<p>
Operating from 26 locations across the world, we bring together teams of creative experts with diverse backgrounds and experiences, who enjoy working and learning in our collaborative and open culture and are committed to world-class delivery.</p>
<p>
We want to continue to grow our team with people just like you!</p>
<h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
About the Role</b></h3>
<p>
We're looking for software architects with broad technical knowledge, full life-cycle project experience and excellent communication skills to bridge the gap between client and engineering teams.</p>
<p><b>
How should our application architecture change and what supporting infrastructure do I need as we migrate to the Cloud?</b></p>
<p><b>
How do we maintain conceptual integrity of our product design as it rapidly evolves?</b></p>
<p><b>
How can we quickly deliver the robust legacy system interfaces needed by our Agile development teams?</b></p>
<p><b>
What do I need to do to integrate data science models into our production business processes and unlock the value of our data?</b></p>
<p>
These are the types of questions that you'll be asked by our clients, your colleagues and yourself at BJSS.</p>
<p>
BJSS has developed some of the most demanding systems around using the latest technologies and techniques &ndash; from the messaging hub that integrates the whole of the NHS, to an application that uses a leading-edge AWS technology stack to underpin a great UX visualising the flightpaths of every plane in the world &ndash; as well as analysing huge quantities of data to improve fuel efficiency, reducing costs and environmental impact. Our architects have always been at the centre of our engagements, managing technical risk and creating real business value.</p>
<h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
About You</b></h3>
<p>
As one of our Architects, you will use your broad technical knowledge, full lifecycle project experience and excellent communication skills to bridge the gap between client and internal delivery managers, enterprise architects, operations teams, UX consultants and developers. You'll be comfortable evaluating a new Open Source technology in a rapid technical spike, presenting to a CIO on a package selection, or working with a technical tester and a support desk engineer to debug a time-critical P1 issue.</p>
<p>
As a technical authority, you lead by example and inspire delivery teams to create great software products that demonstrate the art of the possible. You mentor developers to ensure they see the wider picture and meet our exacting standards, while acknowledging the deep experience they bring from spending hours a day working on a codebase.</p>
<p>
You have energy and a pragmatic, delivery-focused attitude that wins the respect of those around you and makes you a trusted technical advisor. You're willing to be hands-on when you need to be. You balance innovation and intellectual rigour with realism. You love technology and want to keep on learning. You're genuinely interested in understanding the challenges your users face and how you can help them.</p><br>

<p>
We're an award-winning innovative tech consultancy - a team of creative problem solvers. Since 1993 we've been finding better, more sustainable ways to solve complex technology problems for some of the world's leading organisations and delivered solutions that millions of people use every day.</p>
<p>
In the last 30 years we won several awards, including a prestigious Queen's Award for Enterprise in the Innovation category for our Enterprise Agile delivery approach.</p>
<p>
Operating from 26 locations across the world, we bring together teams of creative experts with diverse backgrounds and experiences, who enjoy working and learning in our collaborative and open culture and are committed to world-class delivery.</p>
<p>
We want to continue to grow our team with people just like you!</p>
<h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
About the Role</b></h3>
<p>
We're looking for software architects with broad technical knowledge, full life-cycle project experience and excellent communication skills to bridge the gap between client and engineering teams.</p>
<p><b>
How should our application architecture change and what supporting infrastructure do I need as we migrate to the Cloud?</b></p>
<p><b>
How do we maintain conceptual integrity of our product design as it rapidly evolves?</b></p>
<p><b>
How can we quickly deliver the robust legacy system interfaces needed by our Agile development teams?</b></p>
<p><b>
What do I need to do to integrate data science models into our production business processes and unlock the value of our data?</b></p>
<p>
These are the types of questions that you'll be asked by our clients, your colleagues and yourself at BJSS.</p>
<p>
BJSS has developed some of the most demanding systems around using the latest technologies and techniques &ndash; from the messaging hub that integrates the whole of the NHS, to an application that uses a leading-edge AWS technology stack to underpin a great UX visualising the flightpaths of every plane in the world &ndash; as well as analysing huge quantities of data to improve fuel efficiency, reducing costs and environmental impact. Our architects have always been at the centre of our engagements, managing technical risk and creating real business value.</p>
<h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
About You</b></h3>
<p>
As one of our Architects, you will use your broad technical knowledge, full lifecycle project experience and excellent communication skills to bridge the gap between client and internal delivery managers, enterprise architects, operations teams, UX consultants and developers. You'll be comfortable evaluating a new Open Source technology in a rapid technical spike, presenting to a CIO on a package selection, or working with a technical tester and a support desk engineer to debug a time-critical P1 issue.</p>
<p>
As a technical authority, you lead by example and inspire delivery teams to create great software products that demonstrate the art of the possible. You mentor developers to ensure they see the wider picture and meet our exacting standards, while acknowledging the deep experience they bring from spending hours a day working on a codebase.</p>
<p>
You have energy and a pragmatic, delivery-focused attitude that wins the respect of those around you and makes you a trusted technical advisor. You're willing to be hands-on when you need to be. You balance innovation and intellectual rigour with realism. You love technology and want to keep on learning. You're genuinely interested in understanding the challenges your users face and how you can help them.</p><br>

<p>
We're an award-winning innovative tech consultancy - a team of creative problem solvers. Since 1993 we've been finding better, more sustainable ways to solve complex technology problems for some of the world's leading organisations and delivered solutions that millions of people use every day.</p>
<p>
In the last 30 years we won several awards, including a prestigious Queen's Award for Enterprise in the Innovation category for our Enterprise Agile delivery approach.</p>
<p>
Operating from 26 locations across the world, we bring together teams of creative experts with diverse backgrounds and experiences, who enjoy working and learning in our collaborative and open culture and are committed to world-class delivery.</p>
<p>
We want to continue to grow our team with people just like you!</p>
<h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
About the Role</b></h3>
<p>
We're looking for software architects with broad technical knowledge, full life-cycle project experience and excellent communication skills to bridge the gap between client and engineering teams.</p>
<p><b>
How should our application architecture change and what supporting infrastructure do I need as we migrate to the Cloud?</b></p>
<p><b>
How do we maintain conceptual integrity of our product design as it rapidly evolves?</b></p>
<p><b>
How can we quickly deliver the robust legacy system interfaces needed by our Agile development teams?</b></p>
<p><b>
What do I need to do to integrate data science models into our production business processes and unlock the value of our data?</b></p>
<p>
These are the types of questions that you'll be asked by our clients, your colleagues and yourself at BJSS.</p>
<p>
BJSS has developed some of the most demanding systems around using the latest technologies and techniques &ndash; from the messaging hub that integrates the whole of the NHS, to an application that uses a leading-edge AWS technology stack to underpin a great UX visualising the flightpaths of every plane in the world &ndash; as well as analysing huge quantities of data to improve fuel efficiency, reducing costs and environmental impact. Our architects have always been at the centre of our engagements, managing technical risk and creating real business value.</p>
<h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
About You</b></h3>
<p>
As one of our Architects, you will use your broad technical knowledge, full lifecycle project experience and excellent communication skills to bridge the gap between client and internal delivery managers, enterprise architects, operations teams, UX consultants and developers. You'll be comfortable evaluating a new Open Source technology in a rapid technical spike, presenting to a CIO on a package selection, or working with a technical tester and a support desk engineer to debug a time-critical P1 issue.</p>
<p>
As a technical authority, you lead by example and inspire delivery teams to create great software products that demonstrate the art of the possible. You mentor developers to ensure they see the wider picture and meet our exacting standards, while acknowledging the deep experience they bring from spending hours a day working on a codebase.</p>
<p>
You have energy and a pragmatic, delivery-focused attitude that wins the respect of those around you and makes you a trusted technical advisor. You're willing to be hands-on when you need to be. You balance innovation and intellectual rigour with realism. You love technology and want to keep on learning. You're genuinely interested in understanding the challenges your users face and how you can help them.</p><br>

<p>
We want to continue to grow our team with people just like you!</p>
<h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
About the Role</b></h3>
<p>
We're looking for software architects with broad technical knowledge, full life-cycle project experience and excellent communication skills to bridge the gap between client and engineering teams.</p>
<p><b>
How should our application architecture change and what supporting infrastructure do I need as we migrate to the Cloud?</b></p>
<p><b>
How do we maintain conceptual integrity of our product design as it rapidly evolves?</b></p>
<p><b>
How can we quickly deliver the robust legacy system interfaces needed by our Agile development teams?</b></p>
<p><b>
What do I need to do to integrate data science models into our production business processes and unlock the value of our data?</b></p>
<p>
These are the types of questions that you'll be asked by our clients, your colleagues and yourself at BJSS.</p>
<p>
BJSS has developed some of the most demanding systems around using the latest technologies and techniques &ndash; from the messaging hub that integrates the whole of the NHS, to an application that uses a leading-edge AWS technology stack to underpin a great UX visualising the flightpaths of every plane in the world &ndash; as well as analysing huge quantities of data to improve fuel efficiency, reducing costs and environmental impact. Our architects have always been at the centre of our engagements, managing technical risk and creating real business value.</p>
<h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
About You</b></h3>
<p>
As one of our Architects, you will use your broad technical knowledge, full lifecycle project experience and excellent communication skills to bridge the gap between client and internal delivery managers, enterprise architects, operations teams, UX consultants and developers. You'll be comfortable evaluating a new Open Source technology in a rapid technical spike, presenting to a CIO on a package selection, or working with a technical tester and a support desk engineer to debug a time-critical P1 issue.</p>
<p>
As a technical authority, you lead by example and inspire delivery teams to create great software products that demonstrate the art of the possible. You mentor developers to ensure they see the wider picture and meet our exacting standards, while acknowledging the deep experience they bring from spending hours a day working on a codebase.</p>
<p>
You have energy and a pragmatic, delivery-focused attitude that wins the respect of those around you and makes you a trusted technical advisor. You're willing to be hands-on when you need to be. You balance innovation and intellectual rigour with realism. You love technology and want to keep on learning. You're genuinely interested in understanding the challenges your users face and how you can help them.</p><br>

You balance innovation and intellectual rigour with realism. You love technology and want to keep on learning.

As one of our Architects, you will use your broad technical knowledge, full lifecycle project experience and excellent communication skills to bridge the gap between client and internal delivery managers, enterprise architects, operations teams, UX consultants and developers. You'll be comfortable evaluating a new Open Source technology in a rapid technical spike, presenting to a CIO on a package selection, or working with a technical tester and a support desk engineer to debug a time-critical P1 issue.</p>
<p>
As a technical authority, you lead by example and inspire delivery teams to create great software products that demonstrate the art of the possible. You mentor developers to ensure they see the wider picture and meet our exacting standards, while acknowledging the deep experience they bring from spending hours a day working on a codebase.</p>
<p>
You have energy and a pragmatic, delivery-focused attitude that wins the respect of those around you and makes you a trusted technical advisor. You're willing to be hands-on when you need to be. You balance innovation and intellectual rigour with realism. You love technology and want to keep on learning. You're genuinely interested in understanding the challenges your users face and how you can help them.</p><br>
