About Ferguson Construction & Our Culture 
Ferguson Construction (FC) is a regionally established General Contractor that has been in business for over 100 years. FC has vast experience in the heavy and light industrial, commercial, healthcare, and institutional markets. Along with our in-house design department, Ferguson self performs concrete, masonry, steel erection, general carpentry, and sheet metal roofing and siding trades. FC corporate headquarters is located in Sidney, Ohio. FC operates regional offices in Sidney, Dayton and Columbus, Ohio, as well as east of Indianapolis, Indiana. The company employs 325 employees and is growing. 
Ferguson is different from other General Contractors in a variety of ways. One of the more noteworthy aspects of the organization is the fact that two of our senior-most executives, our CEO and President, have been with the organization a combined 71 years. This provides unique stability that unifies the organization in a way that affords material competitive advantage. Ferguson is very collegial, collaborative and friendly. It is a highly principled organization that offers all employees opportunities to contribute, develop and flourish in ways other organizations don't offer. Our culture is very family-friendly and supportive of employees who have obligations outside of work. It is an easy place to want to work for a long time, and that is the type of employee we're sourcing - someone with a stable job history and track record of being able to work as part of a collaborative team.

This provides unique stability that unifies the organization in a way that affords material competitive advantage. Ferguson is very collegial, collaborative and friendly. It is a highly principled organization that offers all employees opportunities to contribute, develop and flourish in ways other organizations don't offer. Our culture is very family-friendly and supportive of employees who have obligations outside of work. It is an easy place to want to work for a long time, and that is the type of employee we're sourcing - someone with a stable job history and track record of being able to work as part of a collaborative team.

About Ferguson Construction & Our Culture 
Ferguson Construction (FC) is a regionally established General Contractor that has been in business for over 100 years. FC has vast experience in the heavy and light industrial, commercial, healthcare, and institutional markets.

Ferguson is different from other General Contractors in a variety of ways. One of the more noteworthy aspects of the organization is the fact that two of our senior-most executives, our CEO and President, have been with the organization a combined 71 years. This provides unique stability that unifies the organization in a way that affords material competitive advantage. Ferguson is very collegial, collaborative and friendly. It is a highly principled organization that offers all employees opportunities to contribute, develop and flourish in ways other organizations don't offer. Our culture is very family-friendly and supportive of employees who have obligations outside of work. It is an easy place to want to work for a long time, and that is the type of employee we're sourcing - someone with a stable job history and track record of being able to work as part of a collaborative team.

It is a highly principled organization that offers all employees opportunities to contribute, develop and flourish in ways other organizations don't offer. Our culture is very family-friendly and supportive of employees who have obligations outside of work.

This provides unique stability that unifies the organization in a way that affords material competitive advantage. Ferguson is very collegial, collaborative and friendly. It is a highly principled organization that offers all employees opportunities to contribute, develop and flourish in ways other organizations don't offer. Our culture is very family-friendly and supportive of employees who have obligations outside of work. It is an easy place to want to work for a long time, and that is the type of employee we're sourcing - someone with a stable job history and track record of being able to work as part of a collaborative team.

This provides unique stability that unifies the organization in a way that affords material competitive advantage. Ferguson is very collegial, collaborative and friendly. It is a highly principled organization that offers all employees opportunities to contribute, develop and flourish in ways other organizations don't offer. Our culture is very family-friendly and supportive of employees who have obligations outside of work. It is an easy place to want to work for a long time, and that is the type of employee we're sourcing - someone with a stable job history and track record of being able to work as part of a collaborative team.

This provides unique stability that unifies the organization in a way that affords material competitive advantage. Ferguson is very collegial, collaborative and friendly. It is a highly principled organization that offers all employees opportunities to contribute, develop and flourish in ways other organizations don't offer. Our culture is very family-friendly and supportive of employees who have obligations outside of work. It is an easy place to want to work for a long time, and that is the type of employee we're sourcing - someone with a stable job history and track record of being able to work as part of a collaborative team.

About Ferguson Construction & Our Culture 
Ferguson Construction (FC) is a regionally established General Contractor that has been in business for over 100 years. FC has vast experience in the heavy and light industrial, commercial, healthcare, and institutional markets. Along with our in-house design department, Ferguson self performs concrete, masonry, steel erection, general carpentry, and sheet metal roofing and siding trades. FC corporate headquarters is located in Sidney, Ohio. FC operates regional offices in Sidney, Dayton and Columbus, Ohio, as well as east of Indianapolis, Indiana. The company employs 325 employees and is growing. 
Ferguson is different from other General Contractors in a variety of ways. One of the more noteworthy aspects of the organization is the fact that two of our senior-most executives, our CEO and President, have been with the organization a combined 71 years. This provides unique stability that unifies the organization in a way that affords material competitive advantage. Ferguson is very collegial, collaborative and friendly. It is a highly principled organization that offers all employees opportunities to contribute, develop and flourish in ways other organizations don't offer. Our culture is very family-friendly and supportive of employees who have obligations outside of work. It is an easy place to want to work for a long time, and that is the type of employee we're sourcing - someone with a stable job history and track record of being able to work as part of a collaborative team.

This provides unique stability that unifies the organization in a way that affords material competitive advantage. Ferguson is very collegial, collaborative and friendly. It is a highly principled organization that offers all employees opportunities to contribute, develop and flourish in ways other organizations don't offer. Our culture is very family-friendly and supportive of employees who have obligations outside of work. It is an easy place to want to work for a long time, and that is the type of employee we're sourcing - someone with a stable job history and track record of being able to work as part of a collaborative team.
