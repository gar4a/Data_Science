Working with field central engineers if the problem is more serious
-

Continuous learner – you seek out ways to constantly develop your skills and invest in learning every single week
- 
Agile – you pivot easily within a constantly changing environment and are comfortable with a high degree of change
- 
Risk-taker – you see failure as part of the learning process and do it time and again; are you the type to not hold back on whenever you have an idea; are you not scared to try something new, and will do your best in collecting data and analytics to make sure that your ideas are foolproof
Who you are NOT
- 
Individual contributor – you wait for directives from management and work individually to accomplish goals

Continuous learner – you seek out ways to constantly develop your skills and invest in learning every single week
- 
Agile – you pivot easily within a constantly changing environment and are comfortable with a high degree of change
- 
Risk-taker – you see failure as part of the learning process and do it time and again; are you the type to not hold back on whenever you have an idea; are you not scared to try something new, and will do your best in collecting data and analytics to make sure that your ideas are foolproof
Who you are NOT
- 
Individual contributor – you wait for directives from management and work individually to accomplish goals
- 
Specialist - you specialize in a specific discipline in order to gain an ever-deeper understanding and contribute your key expertise in that area

- 
Agile – you pivot easily within a constantly changing environment and are comfortable with a high degree of change
- 
Risk-taker – you see failure as part of the learning process and do it time and again; are you the type to not hold back on whenever you have an idea; are you not scared to try something new, and will do your best in collecting data and analytics to make sure that your ideas are foolproof

- 
Agile – you pivot easily within a constantly changing environment and are comfortable with a high degree of change
- 
Risk-taker – you see failure as part of the learning process and do it time and again; are you the type to not hold back on whenever you have an idea; are you not scared to try something new, and will do your best in collecting data and analytics to make sure that your ideas are foolproof
Who you are NOT
- 
Individual contributor – you wait for directives from management and work individually to accomplish goals
- 
Specialist - you specialize in a specific discipline in order to gain an ever-deeper understanding and contribute your key expertise in that area

Some tasks you may be involved in include:
- 
Working with staff to identify computer problems and advising on the solution
- 
Working with field central engineers if the problem is more serious
- 
Installing and configuring computer hardware, software, systems, networks, printers, and scanners
- 
Monitoring and maintaining computer systems and networks
- 
Responding in a timely manner to service issues and requests
- 
Providing technical support across the company (this may be in person or over the phone)
- 
Testing and fixing faulty equipment

Creative – you find unique ways to solve difficult problems and challenge the status quo
- 
Self-managing - you take full ownership of driving tasks to completion, and helping those around you in doing the same
- 
Collaborative – you recognize that working as a team yields more effective results than working alone; do you value your workplace culture and your coworkers' experiences over chasing compensation; do you challenge others and set high goals for yourself and the people around them; do you want to spread your knowledge and insights to those around you in order to make them better.
- 
Results-driven – you focus on projects that deliver value to the end-user; do you chase the ability to cause change and disrupt industries; are you the type to find solutions to major problems
- 
Business savvy – you understand your clients and deliver solutions that cater to their needs
- 
Cross-disciplinary – you have skills that span across disciplines and are comfortable playing different roles in more than just one area
- 
Continuous learner – you seek out ways to constantly develop your skills and invest in learning every single week
- 
Agile – you pivot easily within a constantly changing environment and are comfortable with a high degree of change
- 
Risk-taker – you see failure as part of the learning process and do it time and again; are you the type to not hold back on whenever you have an idea; are you not scared to try something new, and will do your best in collecting data and analytics to make sure that your ideas are foolproof
Who you are NOT
- 
Individual contributor – you wait for directives from management and work individually to accomplish goals
- 
Specialist - you specialize in a specific discipline in order to gain an ever-deeper understanding and contribute your key expertise in that area
- 
Traditional – you thrive within structured corporate organizations where roles and titles are clearly defined, and where you can climb the corporate ladder
- 
Management – you’ve established yourself as a manager within a hierarchy and are responsible for following and enforcing traditional HR practices
-

- 
Conservative – you stick with what has worked in the past, you are uncomfortable challenging the status quo, and generally avoid taking risks and trying new approaches
- 
Linear – you are most comfortable working in a traditional project plan/Gantt chart environment

Continuous learner – you seek out ways to constantly develop your skills and invest in learning every single week
- 
Agile – you pivot easily within a constantly changing environment and are comfortable with a high degree of change
- 
Risk-taker – you see failure as part of the learning process and do it time and again; are you the type to not hold back on whenever you have an idea; are you not scared to try something new, and will do your best in collecting data and analytics to make sure that your ideas are foolproof
Who you are NOT
- 
Individual contributor – you wait for directives from management and work individually to accomplish goals
- 
Specialist - you specialize in a specific discipline in order to gain an ever-deeper understanding and contribute your key expertise in that area

- 
Risk-taker – you see failure as part of the learning process and do it time and again; are you the type to not hold back on whenever you have an idea; are you not scared to try something new, and will do your best in collecting data and analytics to make sure that your ideas are foolproof

- 
Agile – you pivot easily within a constantly changing environment and are comfortable with a high degree of change
- 
Risk-taker – you see failure as part of the learning process and do it time and again; are you the type to not hold back on whenever you have an idea; are you not scared to try something new, and will do your best in collecting data and analytics to make sure that your ideas are foolproof
