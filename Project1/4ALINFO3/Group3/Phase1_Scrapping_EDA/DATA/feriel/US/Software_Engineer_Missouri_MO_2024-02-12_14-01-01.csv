Tasks can include installing and configuring computer systems, diagnosing hardware/software faults, and solving technical problems, either over the phone or face-to-face.
Most importantly, as businesses cannot afford to be without the whole system, or individual workstations, for more than the minimum time taken to repair or replace them, your technical support is vital to the ongoing operational efficiency of the company.
Some tasks you may be involved in include:
- 
Working with staff to identify computer problems and advising on the solution
- 
Working with field central engineers if the problem is more serious
- 
Installing and configuring computer hardware, software, systems, networks, printers, and scanners

Cross-disciplinary – you have skills that span across disciplines and are comfortable playing different roles in more than just one area
- 
Continuous learner – you seek out ways to constantly develop your skills and invest in learning every single week
- 
Agile – you pivot easily within a constantly changing environment and are comfortable with a high degree of change
- 
Risk-taker – you see failure as part of the learning process and do it time and again; are you the type to not hold back on whenever you have an idea; are you not scared to try something new, and will do your best in collecting data and analytics to make sure that your ideas are foolproof
Who you are NOT
- 
Individual contributor – you wait for directives from management and work individually to accomplish goals
- 
Specialist - you specialize in a specific discipline in order to gain an ever-deeper understanding and contribute your key expertise in that area
- 
Traditional – you thrive within structured corporate organizations where roles and titles are clearly defined, and where you can climb the corporate ladder
- 
Management – you’ve established yourself as a manager within a hierarchy and are responsible for following and enforcing traditional HR practices
